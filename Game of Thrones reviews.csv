1,4.5,"This is an epic masterpiece, a huge free sandbox, a brawl between the seven kingdoms, where humans, ghosts, and dragons fight against each other. The graphics and freshness greatly satisfy the audience."

1,4.0,Awesome and Enjoy to watch in 2024
1,5.0,"Re-watched this after a decade and it still absolutely engages you. In hindsight, this was a show that definitely changed expectations of what TV can offer. Extremely good storytelling, art, casting, photography... acting.. Absolute master-piece with very few flaws. I remember, when I first watched it, I had no expectations of it ever getting as big as it did, but it conquered the world soon enough."
1,5.0,"PERFEITO, essa trama que nos fez amar GOT"
1,5.0,"The most important epic story on television, Game of Thrones goes far beyond dragons and white walkers and offers us a very raw medieval political drama."
1,4.0,Was very catchy right away!
1,5.0,Everything good about it has already been said. My favorite season of anything ever
1,4.5,"Unbelievably late to the party… However, Game of Thrones is one of the BEST series I've ever watched. I was blindsided headed into the show, not understanding the hype and glorification. Having now watched all 8 seasons of the HBO mediaeval - fantasy, I am in awe of the show. Game of Thrones follows ‘Nine noble families wage war against each other in order to gain control over the mythical land of Westeros. Meanwhile, a force is rising after millenniums and threatens the existence of living men.' According to Google. This series is very well known for its shocking twists and captivating story elements. Which I must say, it can be VERY horrifying (in a good way!). Typically, I'm not very intrigued by shows/movies set ‘way-back-when'. But Game of Thrones had me HOOKED. There are scenes that have still left me in a state of shock. Looking back over the show, I do feel that the last two seasons fall a little flat. Characters seem to behave in ways that feel dishonest to their previous arcs. The final episode is also very controversial amongst fans. Make no mistake, there are some great episodes within these final seasons. For example, ‘The Long Night' and ‘The Spoils of War'. By all means, don't let these opinions influence your decision to watch the show. Game of Thrones is definitely worth the praise that it gets. I would 100% recommend adding this to your watch list."
1,5.0,"Game of Thrones"" estabeleceu um padrão inigualável para narrativas épicas com sua trama complexa e entrelaçada, cativando espectadores temporada após temporada."
1,5.0,"I'm reviewing this season specifically because it needs more love. I'll keep this one short and sweet… from begging to end you are hooked on character development which led to the mass obsession of what is now ""Game of Thrones"" this 1st season 10000000000% connected every watcher. Even those who don't watch fantasy. Between the build up and unexpected character deaths. It hooked people who thought FRIENDS was the best show of all time…"
1,4.5,"The first season is slow, but it is absolutely worth it!"
1,5.0,Masterpiece in every way
1,5.0,Melhor série do mundo!
1,5.0,A great start to the series hooks the person and is curious about what will happen in the next episode
1,5.0,Hands down greatest fantasy television show made to date. If you have not seen this do yourself a favour and do.
1,5.0,"A near flawless season of television carried by awards worthy performances from Sean Bean and Peter Dinklage, the first season of game of thrones captured everything you'd want from an adaptation of George RR martins fantasy saga"
1,3.5,"Was a nice watch, look forward to the rest"
1,4.0,Pretty solid start to the series. It has lots of moving parts and they all come together well. Absolutely insane cliffhanger at the end!
1,5.0,"One of the most intriguing and shocking television shows ever, and it uses the source material to make a wonderful adaptation."
1,5.0,"Game of Thrones, based on the book series A Song of Ice and Fire by George R.R. Martin, is a fantasy drama series that first premiered on HBO in 2011. The series quickly gained a massive following and became one of the most talked-about shows of the decade. Plot: The plot of Game of Thrones follows multiple noble families as they vie for control of the Seven Kingdoms of Westeros. The show is known for its complex and intricate plotlines, which are filled with political intrigue, backstabbing, and plenty of action. While the series starts off fairly slow, it picks up steam as the various plotlines start to converge. One of the most impressive things about the show is its ability to keep viewers guessing - just when you think you know where a storyline is headed, it takes a surprising turn. Acting: The acting in Game of Thrones is generally very strong. The show features a large ensemble cast, and while there are a few weaker performances, for the most part, the actors bring their A-game. Notably, Peter Dinklage's portrayal of Tyrion Lannister is a standout performance, earning him several Emmy awards. The show also features some excellent child actors, which can be a rarity in TV. Cinematography: The cinematography in Game of Thrones is stunning. The show is shot in various locations around the world, and the landscapes are breathtaking. The battle scenes are particularly impressive, with sweeping shots of armies clashing on the field. Additionally, the show makes great use of special effects to bring its fantasy elements to life. Direction: Game of Thrones is well-directed, with many memorable and impactful scenes. One of the show's standout moments is the ""Red Wedding"" episode, which is incredibly well-executed and emotionally devastating. While there are a few missteps in the series (particularly in the later seasons), for the most part, the direction is strong. Music: The music in Game of Thrones is iconic, with composer Ramin Djawadi creating some of the most recognizable TV themes of all time. The score is epic and grand, and it adds a lot to the show's overall feel. Overall, Game of Thrones is a landmark TV series that changed the game for fantasy TV. While there are certainly flaws in the show (particularly in the later seasons), it's hard to deny the impact that it had on popular culture. The show is well-acted, well-directed, and beautifully shot, with a plot that keeps viewers engaged and guessing until the very end. If you're a fan of fantasy or epic dramas, Game of Thrones is definitely worth checking out."
1,5.0,Just Amazing mind Blowing Got Season 🔥🥰
1,5.0,"I wish I could find where to rate the full show. I love GOT! Best ever! HOTD will never be this great and is actually pretty bad. But GOT is excellent! I love everything about it: casting, costumes, scenery, dialogue, CGI... absolutely brilliant! It's sad that House of the Dragons is so awful. I was hoping for another Game of Thrones, but HOTD will never take GOT's crown!"
1,4.0,This is a brutal fantasy world full of injustice but its also one of the best.
1,5.0,Writing : 10/10 Acting : 10/10 Cinematography : 8/10 Costume design : 10/10 Set design : 10/10 CGI Effects 8/10 Artistic vision 10/10 Adaptation ranking : 9/10
1,4.5,One of the best cliffhangers of TV history.
1,5.0,"The first time I watched this season I couldnt really follow the plot as the volume on the old Dvd format was really low, but after the first rewatch it was definitely extremely entertaining and kept me glued to the screen the whole time, a solid 10/10 series, no wonder it still receives so much love and attention to this day."
1,5.0,One of the best shows ever made.
1,5.0,"Seasons 1, 2, 3, and 4 have very good material to work with. The others do not. Skip those and read."
1,5.0,"Amazing! So many characters that you love (or hate). So many different personal stories as well as the overall story bringing them altogether. The way it is told moves you from one character/location to another, and it's perfect. This is one of my favourite shows ever!"
1,5.0,What started everything! This isn't your everyday show. Not for the faint-hearted indeed.
1,2.5,as everyone says the first 4 seasons are good
1,5.0,Great introduction with amazing worldbuilding along with superb acting and writing.
1,1.5,"Extremely slow, tedious, pointless up until I couldn't watch anymore in the middle of the 2nd episode. It's disgusting and I can watch disgusting if there's a point. I kept waiting for the point of it all because of it's popularity and great reviews. Eventually I just couldn't stomach anymore. Honestly can't understand this shows popularity."
1,1.0,Great story masked by relentless chauvinism and tryhard shock value.
1,5.0,excellent season 1 and characters
1,4.0,A good pilot season to the show. Overall the story was inviting for fans who have never read the books and there is enough action and suspense to keep everyone entertained. Great show but lacks in comparison a bit to the seasons to come (and thats a good thing)
1,5.0,Wow! Bring back that LoTR vibe!
1,4.0,"I started watching once they were already a few seasons in, and then I binged. This was the first TV show I ever binged. Once I got started I couldn't stop. I'd never seen anything like it on TV. It was the closest thing to Lord of the Rings as a TV Show. But instead of relying on fantasy/fighting like LOTR, Game of Thrones had the witty banter and strategic maneuvering of a modern-day political drama (sort of like Medieval Hour of Cards). And then, they introduced the Magical creatures: Dragons, White Walkers...and it all started to turn into a Marvel Movie for me. What's the point of all of the strategic maneuvering if it's going to come down to a zombie/dragon fight? And then...the last season happened. While I respect how they completely f****d with everything super fans were hoping for, it was too much happening too quick, and with very little justification. Still, GOT deserves to be in the hall of fame of shows. It completely changed what viewers now expect in a blockbuster tv show."
1,5.0,Great medieval type fantasy show that is not afraid to kill off fan favorite characters. The plot unravels with a realism that is seldom seen in shows. A character is just as likely to die from a random disease or random unforeseen event than they are from a carefully calculated plot device or epic battle. Unfortunately you will be disappointed with the last season that will go on to pretty much erase major plot points and straight ignore character arcs/developments to reach an ending that was told to show runners by the author of the unfinished book series. It feels like due to the lack of source materials showrunners were unsure how to provide a satisfactory path to that ending so they sprinted to the finish line without caution. Fans would have been better served if showrunners took a chance and formed their own ending.
1,5.0,Best fantasy TV show ever made
1,4.0,This season got me hooked to the series since that scene with Daenerys and the fire.
1,5.0,Great show based on a even better book series
1,4.0,"Its intricate storytelling and dark themes may overwhelm some viewers, but Game of Thrones is a transportive, well-acted, smartly written drama even non-genre fans can appreciate."
1,5.0,"Just the best, ned stark will forever be my fav"
1,4.5,"At times too much nudity and too much story building proves a hindrance for GOT season 1, but it's still jam-packed with great themes, visual mastery, great characters, solid performances and a deeply investing narrative with violence, heart and complexion."
1,5.0,"The first season, is amazing i loved every second of it, 10 min in and i was hooked. love the starks, and how the charcters evolve and the develope of the charcters was the best until season 7 this was amazing, some episodes from season 8 was ok the long night but after that it fall apart at the end... Best Charcter is John Snow."
1,5.0,"Amazing introduction to the series, thrilling action, powerful acting and an compelling story to tell made this a really good watch!"
1,5.0,"Where can I start? It is absolutely brutal, dark, sinister, nasty, gross but well-written, well-acted, gripping, interesting, epic and exciting as well. I have trouble remembering every single character and place, but nothing too bad to handle. This series started off STRONG, and it won't lower its level, I'm sure! A series full of bastards, cripples and broken things, but full of fantasy and amazing drama as well! By the way, the song is just so iconic that I can't even skip the intro!"
1,5.0,The season that got me hooked but let's not talk about the final 2 seasons
1,1.0,"I really liked the way it was filmed, the setting was beautiful and the costumes were very well done. I wanted to like it, it looked so cool. But after watching some of it, I was left in a foul mood, just feeling annoyed at all the unpleasant characters I had to watch, all the unpleasant things I had to see. It's simply not a world I want to look at, it is a bleak world that leaves me feeling depressed. There is little charity, kindness, and justice in it, and without those things there is no reason to care. Maybe they come into the mix later on in the series, but I am not going to stick around to look for it, I have had enough. I didn't want to root for anyone, as I didn't like anyone. I felt there was much injustice and dishonesty, and for me, seeing a lot of that is viscerally irritating. If there is a moderate amount, if it isn't excessively dark and something is done about it, that's fine. But that is not the impression I got. If you enjoy this sort of thing, there's nothing wrong with that. I write this review for others out there who might feel like me. Thanks for reading."
1,5.0,One of the Best fantasy story on screen and best season of all GoT
1,4.5,Fantastic in all respects until the final half season.
1,3.5,"Re-watching season 1 made me realize it's extremely flawed. The acting is very mediocre, some of the directing choices are elementary, and there's way too much unnecessary nudity. Like a horny director was getting off on set. However, the story and characters are still fantastic."
1,4.5,Near enough perfect.
1,5.0,"The first three seasons of GoT are by far the best. Medieval in setting and tone, gritty and creative and genuine—faithful adaptations of Martin's brilliant work."
1,5.0,"One of the best first seasons ever made. Book was better but what a great transformation in video. Cast, story, scenery, amazing!"
1,5.0,"The best season, critics have no brain"
1,4.5,"I thoroughly enjoyed this season. In the beginning, the story is quite convoluted and all the different stories and sub-plots don't necessarily connect for first-time viewers, but they did a fantastic job bringing the story to life. And in the end, Sean Bean does what Sean Bean does best... Great stuff!"
1,5.0,"Loved this show, perfect start!"
1,5.0,These first few seasons were edge of your seat and addictive to watch!
1,5.0,Awesome! Probably the best show ever.
1,5.0,"Perfect in every single way. Courageous, trail blazing television. Sticks to the source material. Incredible world building. Great costumes, great actors, great story, great sets."
1,5.0,Season 1 of Game of Thrones is potentially the greatest Season 1 of any show ever
1,5.0,I liked George R. R. Martin story and it was beautifully portrayed close to the original material.
1,5.0,"all elements brilliantly treated, a ruthless and raw beginning that leaves the viewer wanting more, a guideline with an assertive approach."
1,5.0,"One of the best seasons for a tv show in tv history. The climax was amazing storytelling, and it was aggressive to kill off most of the major names involved with the show."
1,5.0,So far it is great. I love everything about it so far. It managed to have me intrigued by the first episode which I usually find rare for most shows. All I can really say is that it is a lot better than I expected and I'm excited to see the next season.
1,4.0,"An almost unequaled introduction to a complex world and narrative that has fantastic production quality, acting, and writing to go with it. While you can feel some of the budget constraints with this being the first season, it executes magnificently to where that is at most a minor complaint, and still feels epic and grandiose regardless. Truly as great of a start to a series as you could hope for."
1,5.0,"Few series quite as perfect as this one. Just one thing,,,,did winter ever really come?"
1,4.0,"seeing this in 2022 for the 1st time doesn't give this show justice (imo) it's a great show with a amazing storyline (f*qing love it) and characters but seeing some old vfx now -its looking kinda weird and there are a lot of questionable camera angles as well. Absolutely love this show. why did i just watched it now? idk, Gen Z tings..."
1,5.0,Absolutely brilliant loved it the mix of medieval theme and fantasy dragon and white walkers it's brilliant and love it
1,0.5,Boring... Tedious... More fighting less talking please...
1,5.0,One word awesome man !!!
1,4.5,"A near-perfect season of television that had me hooked from the very first episode and kept me on my feet until the last, as all series should."
1,5.0,De los mejores dramas fantásticos y políticos de la TV
1,5.0,esta es una gran introduccion para la serie en un drama bien actuado donde hasta los que no han leido los libros van a poder disfrutar
1,5.0,I was hooked from the start and have to admit that the House of Stark became a whole lot less interesting after they killed off Ned.
1,5.0,One of the best shows of all time hands down.
1,4.5,My rating for the s1 is a 9.2/10
1,4.0,"At the End of the Show., I was thinking Woah!! What was that?"
1,5.0,Amazing! I never read the books for this series so I was actually pretty surprised at how great of a story this is!
1,4.5,brings into the world pretty well
1,4.0,"Season 1 is definitely one of the better starts to a series out there because of how built all the characters had gotten towards the end of the series! Many thrilling and impactful moments keeping me wanting more!!! ""Baelor"" & ""A Golden Crown"" are the best episodes of the season exceeding a 9/10!"
1,3.0,"A couple of years ago, this would have received a solid 5 stars from me. But seeing as the last season ruined the rewatch value of past seasons, the collateral damage cannot be denied. Season 1, on its own, is nothing short of a masterpiece—but taking into account the disastrous ending of the show, many of the iconic phrases (""Winter Is Coming"") now ring hollow."
1,4.5,Loved it. I was hanging on the hook every week for the next one.
1,5.0,This work doesn't need my too much elaboration to prove itself.
1,2.5,It is like Lord of the Rings meets Bangbros. Its literally softcore porn sprinkled with recycled medieval story line.
1,5.0,"Stunning, epic, riveting. Must watch. It lures you in from the first few seconds and continues to captivate you. No expense is spared. Film location, actors, costumes, storytelling. You should and must watch Game of Thrones."
1,4.0,"Overly violent, overtly misoginistic, with pedophilia, incest, rape and murder prevalent throughout. And the chest-thumping male dominance and ego are tiresome. But engrossing nonetheless. Peter Dinklage makes the whole series worth watching."
1,5.0,"Dont compare this show to anything else ! its a masterpiece, its unbeattable, its out of this time and space. My favorite ever, dont care about season 8, it remains a masterpiece !"
1,5.0,"The best TV series ever made with a MA rating. the best combination of character development, wardrobe, acting, and film quality I've ever seen. An absolute much watch."
1,5.0,"This show is a masterpiece. There is no doubt in my mind that it isn't. Despite the 8th season that most have agreed doesn't exist. This show remains my favorite of all time. This show changed what makes a show good, and proceeded to change it again, year after year. From the Starks in the North, The Martells in the South, The Lannisters in the West, and the Baratheon's in the East. This show is incredible. The politics and the ""Game of Thrones"" in the capitol, to the forshadowing of the white walkers at the wall, to the fight for the throne. This show is so dahm good. You see the events occur from almost every point of view, and it is all so entertaining. This is 100% one of the best shows of all time."
1,5.0,The start of the greatest tv show I have ever watched. It's so good I wish I could buy a Neuralyzer from MIB and zap myself with it.
1,5.0,"The greatest series ever made, so awesome..."
1,5.0,"Cudowny serial! Ciężko go porównać z jakimś innym widowiskiem telewizyjnym, mam wielką nadzieję że Dom smoka mu dorówna."
1,5.0,"SO many characters and storylines, a little tough to get started, and then 100% worth it! Outstanding show!!"
1,5.0,"Game of Thrones consegue ter uma primeira temporada excelente, mesmo ela não tendo uma grande produção. A série consegue construir muito bem os personagens e ter ótimos diálogos. Muito boa, recomendo muito!"
1,4.5,"Epic, spellbounding and a great intro to the world of ASOIAF"
1,4.5,"At times too much nudity and too much story building proves a hindrance for GOT season 1, but it's still jam-packed with great themes, visual mastery, great characters, solid performances and a deeply investing narrative with violence, heart and complexion."
1,4.5,"Costumes, performances, sets - it's all coming together perfectly in this faithful adaptation of the first installment in Martin's bestselling series."
1,5.0,"Keeping each one of these reviews short, I just want to say that season 1 of GoT is unlike any of the other seasons. I mean that by both how it feels and looks. On top of that, I think it has some of the best dialogue... ever. Not writing, but dialogue. Each scene carries weight. You usually have 2 characters sitting down and talking to one another—and that's fine, because the dialogue is so intriguing and so fresh. Easy to say, this is a fantastic start to the series!"
1,4.0,"I thought this show made a strong showing from the start. Now the ending, lol"
1,5.0,Incredible start to a massive journey. The first episode alone really grabs the viewers attention. The casting team did an amazing job with this series. By the end of season 1 you are already attached to some of the characters. 9/10
1,5.0,esta temporada puede ser muy abrumante pero esta bien escrito con grandes secuencias en la trama
1,4.5,"Such a great series! The writing is exquisit, the characters and their interaction makes the whole world, so interesting and diverse!"
1,5.0,"I slept on this show for too long! This is no doubt a 5/5 show with superb acting, flawless writing and performances. No one can deny how awesome this show is! Wow! Wow! Wow! Season one sets up the world and gives you just enough mystery to keep you coming back to watch more!"
1,5.0,Inicia muito bem a jornada da série.
1,5.0,"A primeira temporada é uma obra de arte, absolutamente incrível e imersiva, além de muito bem escrita sabe ser envolvente em todos os episódios."
1,4.0,"The 1st season of Game Of Thrones lives well to its expectation, the actors well fit the characters, The Character building off Joffrey Baratheon is great, Bran Stark is greatly shown in that season, the Scenes off Dhaeneris Targaryen are really good, everything is goof"
1,3.0,"has great moments and is extremely addictive but there are plots and events that resolve out of nowhere, still good enough to want more"
1,5.0,"Incredible show, at least till it follows the books. After it surpasses the books, problems start. Last season is best not mentioned."
1,4.0,"Sex, violence, incest, intrigue, world building, all top notch. I will be honest, it too 2 tries to get into the series and it was worth it, by episode 3, fully invested. They handled introducing 6 million characters quite well and made the good guys likeable but not mary sue's , bad guys were fleshed out people with motivations that are pretty reasonable even if the methods are really awful. Very engaging made you look forward to the next season."
1,5.0,THIS IS THE TRUE G. O. T. .
1,5.0,"This show was so good, sad to see how it ended (lazy writing etc.)"
1,5.0,Absolutely Breathtaking. Non predictable narrative. Actors portrayal of character is amazing. Not even one person over acts
1,3.5,"It feels like a show finding it's stride. The world is captivating but I never found the main plot line of this season to be very engaging nor exceptionally well presented. There is plenty of other things to enjoy here, though."
1,3.0,"It's a good season but was not very interesting to me. The show picks up for me next season, and the later episodes in the season are vastly superior. However, it sets up the entire story but feels like one long prologue."
1,4.0,"Season 1 to this iconic show starts off a little slow and can be uninteresting if you go in expecting Whitewalkers and Dragons right away, which as you continue to watch the show you'll realize that those aren't the main attraction to this show but rather the politics and characters. This is a great start to an amazing show!"
1,4.5,What to say except that it's just a great show. Not five stars because we're still getting introduced to many characters.
1,5.0,Wonderful Beginning . A Perfect plot with great characters in it. Truly made with great vision and good writing.
1,4.0,The first season closely follows the first book. Great adaptation with memorable characters. A very promising start.
1,5.0,Um dos melhores série que já assisti!
1,0.5,Season 1 set us up to fail for the series failure in season 8.
1,5.0,"Great show, clever story, good cast and beautiful cinematography. I loved this season."
1,5.0,A great introduction to the amazing series it would become!
1,5.0,"A estreia de Game of Thrones na TV pode não ter sido perfeita, ainda faltava ajustes aqui e ali em termos de produção, figurino e efeitos – até cometendo o pecado de cortar uma batalha grandiosa por questões orçamentárias – mas é a temporada que nos conquista. Todos os personagens são carismáticos e envolventes, e David Benioff e D.B. Weiss oferecem uma adaptação perfeita do primeiro livro da saga. Nostálgica. E a segunda melhor temporada de Game of Thrones!"
1,5.0,"The start of the series is in many ways a breakthrough, not only for the fantasy genre but also tele-vision in general. The show is interesting right away with its dark tone and few boundaries. Softer themes like love and hope are also well implemented, preventing the show from becoming too depressing. The show is written very tightly, there are at once many a lot of things going and at the same time the story moves forward relatively quickly. The show also finds clever ways to give exposition/lore with scenes between characters who didn't have perspectives in the book- while creating empathy and insight into those characters. While much of this can be hard to catch the first time around, it makes the show incredibly satisfying to return to for repeat viewings. The season also ends very strong, even though none of the overall plot threads have been resolved yet. The first season is a magnificent example of long-term storytelling- something many other stories can learn from- and few others can live up to."
1,4.5,"awesome first season, already know i will love this series"
1,5.0,"Game of Thrones: Season 1 was a brilliant start to the show, introducing us to all the characters we would be following for the next eight seasons. The murder mystery leading up to the War of the Five Kings was a perfect way to start off the show and the characters are absolutely amazing."
1,5.0,It is like war man seriously it does
1,5.0,The most impressive quality of Game of Thrones is its ability to give those who have never touched a fantasy book in their life a sincere childlike wonder for the genre's tropes overnight.
1,5.0,"An extraordinary season, an all-pervading and profound building of the world, intelligent dialogue with lots of memorable quotes, genuine surprises, expert acting, excellent soundtrack that is used sparingly, epic set - pieces, detailed rendering and exhaustive plot that goes forward little by little, and then perfectly paced suspension of disbelief, the plot is also huge and amazing, but often favorite characters end up fatal letting us know that no character is safe and that it can very easily be killed or fooled. All episodes are exceptional, and ""Baelor"" and ""Fire and Blood"" stand out as the highest quality. The season contains a lot of violence and blood, sexual violence, sex, nudity, profanity (mostly sexual dialogues), use of various types of narcotic drugs, etc. so for some it can all be too strong, but this season of Game of Thrones is impeccable perfection and something must be seen no matter what genre, which actor or director you prefer and how much violence you tolerate."
1,4.0,Very good start to the beginning of a great show.
1,4.0,"This season was a good one. The script is well developed, the roles are good, but what I didn't like was that they killed my favorite character and is the main character in the season."
1,5.0,"Unlike any fantasy series I've ever seen. This season is based on politics rather than magic and dragons, but it is thrilling nonetheless."
1,4.0,"The first season of GOT is not as good as some of the others, but because of that, it makes for a good introduction into the world known as Westeros!"
1,4.0,"After what I heard about the series of having great dragon scenes and great battles, I was a little disappointed because I was expecting it this season, but other than that it is a good season, realistic and violent."
1,5.0,"Game of Thrones S1 is an EXCELLENT adaptation of one of the best books I've ever read. It's humane, mundane and severe. Extraordinary."
1,4.0,First I'm not familia with the source material so I won't be discussing or compare the first season to any of the books by comparison Game of thrones is a show I've wanted to get in to for a long time but simply never got around to it and with a lot of time between seasons towards it end I simply decided s to wait until it's finished before getting around to it Now the how shal I say this Viking/med evil times is not my favourite error to utilise on film or tv nothing against it just not for me game of thrones changed that Game of thrones ability to manage multiple plots a fairly big array of characters shift in perspective through its many characters and killing of who is arguably its main character right before the season final is impressive ballsy and intense and the action is off the chain and some of it just gory as fuck I also like how it plays on morals right and wrong war and it's effects o and I just get to say it the Lannister's are ass wholes.😂 Never before have I out right hated characters such as I hated this family normally I can really get an understanding of a villain although evil they can be cool relatable or just fun to enjoy this family is none of that Over all it's a great series and it's only just be gain another brilliant show by HBO looks forward to the rest RIP Ned
1,4.5,A great adaptation of an even greater source material. Watch this season and then go read the books.
1,3.5,"""Only pass the time."" ... As promised, I rethought the note I gave to ""game of thrones"". The last episode of the season there deserved another half star. The person knows why I improved the grade. Hug and congratulations!"
1,0.5,"I kept thinking ""that looks like something from 1980's 'Excalibur""...that looks like something from one of those 'story-themed' porn movies from about the same time...they sure did have great training equipment at the gym...are those private parts silicone...fabulous dental work...I'll take Tarantino's ridiculous cartoon violence over all these amputations...thank goodness for the episode recaps cause I was mostly confused."" Overall, I liked 'Caligula' better: both stupendously violent with lots of sex all kinds of sex. But at least 'Caligula' knew it was absurd. I'll try one more season...after all, the people are rather beautiful."
1,4.5,"First season sets the atmosphere of game of thrones: Dark, raw, exciting and captivating"
1,4.5,Great season but takes a bit to get into at first because theres so many characters and storylines happening everytime I'd look away from the screen I had to rewind it just so I didn't miss anything and it was slow at times but halfway through the season I was proper into it
1,5.0,Absolutely fantastic.
1,5.0,"Can't stop thinking about this story and season, after you've watched it. Simply stunning."
1,5.0,"This was so awesome I still can't believe how it turned into a total shitshow in the last, awfully wrong season 8. Thankfully I didn't know at that time so I will always cherish in my memories."
1,5.0,Who's going to die next? I don't even know
1,4.5,Game of Thrones Season 1 | Detailed note: 9.2
1,4.0,Sensacional. Una series maravillosa.
1,4.5,"Different tone and focus from the books, as the books were scarier. But a good adaptation. Worth learning the characters to get invested into the storyline."
1,3.0,"Sobrevalorada. Partes violentísimas con gore innecesario, partes intrascendentes (la de la rubia). Sólo vi la 1.ª temp y fue suficiente"
1,4.5,I have been an avid fan and watcher on the wall since the premier night of this groundbreaking show and series. I cannot recommend it enough to fans of both fantasy and real-world and politics. This is a must see of and quintessential classic of this generation.
1,5.0,it's a great tv show the best thing is that you'll be allways nerves on what's next because ****** you need to figure out your self !! so don't wast your time and go watch it! are you still here ?! goooooooooo!!!
1,5.0,"A nitty gritty show, depicting the brutal & conniving world of Westeros. Full of political back stabbing, scheming and a whole host of nasty characters, the series is a wonderful exploration of a Medieval Times. The shows greatest attributes is its, wonderfully expanse cast & the ridiculous budget allotted to it in order to make this story come to life."
1,0.5,Most overrated show of all time I was waiting for some character or even just some welly filmed action but never got either in all of these seasons
1,5.0,"Great set-up for each character's story. Great acting, landscape, costume design, acting. Loved it."
1,4.5,"Great story telling, amazing action as we are introduced to the world of Westoros in a fashion that leaves us clamoring for more"
1,5.0,"masterpiece, its so good"
1,5.0,Desde el primer capítulo hasta el final de temporada te mantiene al filo del asiento.
1,5.0,"Even if u hated the ending this is by far the greatest show of all time. Each episode keeps u on the edge of your seat. Never have i ever heard as many people talk about whats gunna happen next week. There was just a lot of people upset because they didn't get what they want but that is what the whole show was, you never got what u wanat."
1,5.0,"A huge applause for the GOT crew because of the creation of characters, the story flow everything seems to be amazing."
1,3.5,Books are better but I enjoyed this
1,3.5,"The cast is brilliant, with complex character development and the story line is gripping, powered up by an exceptionally well-written script and spectacular settings and, if I was a critic, I would take this season on its own terms and give it five stars. But I also write as a human being with my own sensibilities and preferences. That said, the Iron Age ethics of that society with its relentless over-the-top cruelty and ultra-violence left me weary and disheartened. Some characters are so abhorrent that I kept hoping to be rid of them with each episode only to be disappointed again and again. Early on, the top two on my personal hit list were the oily slime-bucket, Viserys (the brother of Daenerys Targaren), and the creepy, exceedingly cruel little snit, Joffrey (affectionately known by me as King Shit). I finally got my wish in spades and then some when Kahl Drogo ""crowned"" Viserys. As for King Shit, he was merely poisoned in a later season--so disappointing! The series also featured much graphic nudity, which I am fine with, but it seems that more than a few episodes searched for the flimsiest pretext to make sure to provide at least one nude scene so as to not disappoint the series' rabid fans. In short, the series has an amazing paucity of admirable characters, with the exception of Jon Snow and the Starks. My hopes for a timely end to the perfectly odious sibling pair Jaime and Cersei Lannister are dashed every episode. Daenerys, she is such a hero to fans of the series, but I find her sometimes admirable character to be seasoned with cruelty and vindictiveness. I grudgingly concede the series' acclaim, but for me it is a matter of taste and the violence and cruelty often left a bad taste in my mouth. But I will end on a positive note--the sleazy but lovable Tyrion Lannister really grew on me. And I have to give the series credit where it is due for its very high production values, and superb casting, acting, and writing."
1,5.0,The best show ever! I thought that I wouldn't like because of the time of the story. I not the kind of people who like to see the old era. But the story keeps you want to see more.
1,5.0,"One of the greatest television shows ever made. The first season had one of, if not, the greatest game changing moments for a series in television history. 9.7/10"
1,4.5,"An amazing first season to this show. Not only was this completely unique for its time, making a fantasy show with a budget of its size and writing this good was unheard of and still unheard of today as nobody has really been able to make something of this quality yet. The acting, phenomenal, the writing, gripping, the story, dramatic in all the good ways, the costume, spectacular, the set design, just wow. The casting I feel were perfect, even the child actors. Maisie Williams was like 12 when she was in this season and she fully enraptured Arya Stark. Especially the writing for her character, like you wouldn't expect a child to have the writing or story that she does but she does and she makes it amazing. The plot was also great and very well done. They really balanced all the characters well and I feel like there wasn't a single scene in this show that was wasted. Every single scene tells a story or adds to it and I think that is very difficult to do but they did it amazingly."
1,5.0,Gosh!i can feel every scene in it!literally greatest saga begins with this powerful season pleased me alot!
1,5.0,"One of Best Fantasy Shows ever. Fantastic start. Just great. Characters, Production Design, Costume Design. Story ist fantastic."
1,5.0,Season one set up the world and moved the pieces in place for a show that has secured it's spot in history.
1,5.0,The most beautifull Tv series I have seen
1,5.0,"best, it was really good, i enjoyed it. please give us no2 etc asap. as I WANT MORE !!!!"
1,4.5,"Something special... something that matters... These things are what the show used to be, until it went of its course, and became a shadow of its former glory. And to not just say:""Go and read the books"", I'll have to be frank, and admit that despite the disappointment and saltiness, this show is worth watching."
1,5.0,It's a great show and way better than Teen Titans Go!.
1,3.5,Rating: 7/10. 79/100.
1,5.0,Political intrigue set in medieval times - truly fresh upon its release.
1,1.0,"Ritimo lento serie morta, só ficou bom no final."
1,5.0,"Amazing start of the series, even with a relatively low budget compared to other seasons, they got me stuck to the screen for days. The political intrigue, combined with action, drama and the occasional jokes were a perfect recipe, well executed as well."
1,3.5,Nice characters but the first season is in lack of something to make you watch till the end. Next seasons are better.
1,4.0,Sean Bean carries a brilliant season of television which introduces us to Martin's world and characters.
1,5.0,The best show I have ever seen. Great!!!
1,5.0,The best first season ever ? Probably
1,5.0,Truly awesome. Couldn't wait for the next season!
1,5.0,The first season is the way you do a first season of a series.
1,5.0,A really awesome season and one of the best shows out there i 100% recommend you watch it you will not regret maybe.
1,5.0,"Absolutely spectacular. No disappointments, thrilling and engaging story with an unprecedented amount of tension!"
1,5.0,bc in game of thrones you win or you die
1,4.0,"Strong start, great cast, beautifully shot. The dialogue and over-arcing story structure is great. The exploitative stuff is pretty obnoxious. It will get worse. A few changes from the book weakened certain storylines, but most of that doesn't hurt this first season, it ripples forward to hurt future storylines and therefore isn't our problem yet."
1,5.0,"There were some aesthetic choices that didn't work, but that is probably my only complaint. Wonderful season."
1,5.0,"The start of a series that is in my top 3 favorite tv shows of all time. Sean Bean kills it, Jason Mamoa kills it, the entire cast, the writing, the directing, the production, everything that is amazing about this show starts in this season."
1,5.0,This is just great❤❤❤
1,5.0,"Unpredictable, well acted and directed"
1,5.0,Season 1 remains the strongest in my opinion. It was such a perfect setup for everything to come. (A+)
1,4.0,Great characters and cast and an even better story.
1,5.0,"I am not a fan of fantasy, but this show was so good that it became my favorite TV show ever. That's quite something. The dialogue and character development is so beautifully designed that it hard not to get invested in these characters and their stories. Season 1 laid the foundation for 6 seasons of masterful TV performances and storytelling. The last two seasons suffer from a sharp drop off, but you can stop at season 6 and enjoy them as a complete story. This might be one of the best first seasons of any television show ever. Amazing journey!"
1,5.0,Definitely one the best tv shows ever.
1,5.0,The best start for a show!
1,5.0,So fresh. What a season!
1,0.5,"People like this show? Why? It's disgusting, practically porn with predictable writing. Just watch some violent war documentary or some porn, it's cheaper than buying HBO if that is what makes you happy. Gave it half a star because the costumes were good"
1,2.0,"This season was the best season of the Game of Thrones. However, the close relationship between siblings and having intercourse was something too wring and disgusting. shame on the writer and producers."
1,5.0,Game of Thrones season 1 started off slow but it makes sense because then you get hooked to these amazing characters. Awesome cast and even though the show had a low budget it was able to give us a great experience. Amazing writing and you get hooked up episode by episode. This an absolute must see!!!
1,4.0,"Although it may be annoyingly slow at times, the pace eventually more than picks up in order to form one of the best television endings. Ever."
1,2.0,"I tried to watch it, I did. But God knows, it honestly couldnt grasp me. Maybe it's my fault. Maybe I'm just not a fan of finctional/adaptations ect.. God knows why everybody loves this show so much. With the disappoint of the last season, I'm kinda glad I didn't waste my time watching GOT. I watched S1 and whilst I found some of the characters to be somewhat interesting. Namely Sean Beans character. (Bean is always a pleasure to watch) I found that the entirety of S1 to be far too slow and needlessly filled with awkward sex scenes which you just have to hope your mum doesnt walk in on. I just didn't really see how those scenes moved the story forward and just found it to be repetitive after the 5 or 6 one I had to sit through. I'm not usually a fan of series, and this is no exception. So I hope that is some concession to its fans. Not that anyone cares what I think."
1,4.5,NOBODY IS SAFE - Amazing TV Series definitely worth watching!
1,5.0,Some of the best television ever produced. You'll fall in love with it and hate it at the same time.
1,4.5,Took two goes to get into as the world and story has such depth but by the end of the second episode - totally hooked.
1,1.5,The biggest battle was me trying not to fall asleep while watching the first and only season I viewed. I will never understand how this show became the force that it did
1,5.0,"Early Game of Thrones wasn't just good. If the show could've maintained this level of storytelling for perhaps 9 or 10 seasons, it would've been hard to deny it was the greatest TV show made. Epic fantasy made personal, gritty, and believable."
1,5.0,An introduction into one of the greatest series of all time
1,4.0,"Really good, can be a bit boring in parts."
1,4.0,"Dark, intelligent, and occasionally funny, Game of Thrones Season 1 kicks off this spectacular franchise. The story telling and atmosphere is unlike anything I've seen on tv before, the cast and acting is absolutely too notch. The one negative is the slow pace, but everything else just kinda snuffs that out."
1,4.5,esta serie es brutal
1,5.0,"A perfect adaptation of one of the best works in the fantasy genre! A must watch for anyone, especially those who are fans of the fantasy genre! So much can be said about this series. This season does a great job introducing all the regular fantasy archetypes that are used later to subvert fantasy tropes. Personally, this is my favorite season, as many of the first episodes provide a sense of comfort and escapism that is quickly replaced later by well-written political intrigue and tense plotlines. Both the ending of the first episode and the first season overall definitely work to hook the viewer into watching the entire series."
1,5.0,Television perfection.
1,5.0,People say that this is the TV show of all times for a reason. The start is genius and episode 9 is one of the best episodes of the TV show. The best TV shows I have ever seen :)
1,4.0,I feel these first run of episodes were a great introduction to this fantastic series!
1,5.0,"The beginning of something great. Unfortunately it had to end basically after Season 4 because the writers didn't want to even try to put in any effort into their show after that. To rank the Season really quickly, I'd put it in this order: 4,3,1,2,6,5,7,8. Season 1 does not get good as the climax Season like 3 or 4, but that's only because those Seasons have the most dramatic turning points and moments of greatness. What Season 1 does have is the beginning of everything, and it sets up this world that we love so much brilliantly. Season 1 may not be as good as or 3 or 4, but it's importance to the show is as irreplaceable as the other three Seasons that come after it."
1,5.0,Ok so this show is a top 5 of all time for me. This season would probably rank as the best season of a show I've ever seen. The Wire is still #1 overall but damn this season was good.
1,5.0,I was two seasons behind when I first started watching this but after watching the first scene unfold I quickly caught up within a couple of weeks. The casting is impeccable and the stories make for great entertainment. I love the fact that it can go from funny and light-hearted one minute to brutal and soul-destroying in the next.
1,5.0,"A start to a show that promises tons and delivers! With great characters like the innocent Sansa to the nasty Joffrey this shows got it all. The narrative is great and the world building is some of the best I've seen, though it feels light on the action."
1,5.0,"Hooks you right in, from episode 1. A couple of the newer actors are finding their feet, but still pulling it off. The rest are brilliant. Sean Bean's presence, and Mark Addy's, with Peter Dinklage a revelation ... actually almost all of them are so wonderful, along with top-notch writing and a great story, that the less well-budgeted sets and production values are not noticeable. Wonderful."
1,5.0,"A show with heavy hitting acting and drama with a budget to match its grand vision. Perhaps one of the best fantasy shows ever. Definitely worth watching, though the final season falls flat without the source book having already been written and the script writers focusing on their next project."
1,3.0,"The first 5 episodes was boring AF but once you get passed the 5th episode, the series becomes really good!!"
1,5.0,So Fresh: Absolute Muste See!
1,0.5,"If you're a horny, bloodthirsty 13-year-old boy nerdboy who enjoys faking a British accent and playing dress-up, you're probably all over this show. If you have a modicum of intelligence or self-respect, and find such insipid pseudo-profound statements as, ""Never forget what you are"" uninspiring, pass."
1,5.0,I was completely over whelmed with this TV show.
1,5.0,"Probably the best season of this show. It is gritty, entertaining, complex in its story as well as emotionally and thematically, and it is faithful to the wonderful fantasy world that George R.R. Martin created. Season 1 of Game of Thrones launched one of the most successful TV series of all time, and its actors and writers put to life the high fantasy franchise with the most depth since Tolkien's Middle-Earth. A dour satire of the fantasy genre."
1,5.0,great season starting a great series i love this sean bean at his best
1,5.0,The first season of Game of Thrones starts the legendary series with a masterfully realized world inhabited by complex characters and brutal politics.
1,4.5,"This is a great season to start off GoT. We get to know the characters and the setting. This also leads us into the second season and what it may look like. The twists are great and basically, tell us what the rest of GoT might look like. The only downside to the first season was Deanarys with her not really doing anything; she did contribute to telling us about her story though which is the only good thing about her in the first season of GoT."
1,3.5,The most satisfying season of this show and the most well written. It's all down hill from here.
1,0.5,"If you enjoy gory violence for its own sake, and if you enjoy your tv porn dirty, frequent, and divorced from love. If you like to cheat on your wife with your eyes. Then allow this garbage to rot you from the inside out. Didn't finish out the first episode. No thanks."
1,0.5,"DONT WASTE YOUR time!!!!!!! Ending didn't follow charter traits, zero development....... All you'll say the last season is wtf"
1,5.0,"Awesome, action packed television! The dialogue and character development are second-to-none."
1,5.0,"Game of Thrones is my favorite HBO show, my favorite new show of 2011, my favorite drama show, and my 2nd favorite show of all time. The storytelling and the writing are excellent. The acting is stupendous especially from Emilia Clarke, Peter Dinklage, Sean Bean, Maisie Williams, Kit Harington, Michelle Fairley, Mark Addy, Nikolaj Coster-Waldau, Aidan Gillen, Lena Headey, Iain Glen, and Sophie Turner. The supporting performances from John Bradley, Conleth Hill, Jason Momoa, and Sibel Kekilli was also great. The sets and scenery were terrific, I loved have authentic and real all of the areas looked. The costumes and props were fantastic especially all of the armour, all of the weapons, and the Iron Throne. The visual effects and makeup effects were impressive especially the cut and stab wounds throughout the show and the baby dragons in the season finale. The last scene in the season finale was awesome, I loved it so much, the baby dragons are so cool and cute. I also loved the opening theme and all of Ramin Djawadi's music that was in this season, the music was great. A+ for this season."
1,4.5,"Great start to the show, gets better every time i watch this season. ""Baelor"" will never not be a great episode."
1,4.0,Season 1 successfully grabs the viewers attention and keeps it
1,4.0,"A great first season, quickly captured my attention with the characters and a great story developing!"
1,5.0,a beginning of a legendary
1,5.0,Wow this was great first season
1,4.0,"Great adaptation, though a bit off in places. In hindsight, these variations from the source material should have given us a warning about what would happen once George stopped writing episodes..."
1,5.0,"ï¿½Â?Ð¸ÐºÐ°ï¿½Â?Ð½Ð¾Ðµ Ð½Ð°ï¿½Â?Ð°Ð»Ð¾ Ð¾ï¿½Â?Ð»Ð¸ï¿½Â?Ð½Ð¾Ð¹ Ð¸ï¿½Â?ï¿½Â?Ð¾ï¿½Â?Ð¸Ð¸.

1,5.0,A great kickoff to a great story.
1,5.0,"Amazing TV Show, Acting, Writing (Mostly GRRM not D&D) Shame season 8 ruined this show"
1,4.0,"The first season of Game of Thrones suffers from information dumping and a snail pace, but delivers a compelling opening to a game changing series that sets its pieces up perfectly and shocks while delivering poignant political messages, making this season necessarily tedious and a great hook, even though it takes some time to get acculumated."
1,5.0,Best intro to a show ever & I'm not a fan of the fantasy genre.
1,4.0,"Game of thrones. Must see for people who like glory and gore. Season 1 is still a commendable season ,even in 2019."
1,5.0,Wonderful beginning to a great show.
1,5.0,"Great start to the greatest TV show of all time. Ned Stark was such a great, badass, honourable character. I loved all the characters and got deeply invested in the show right from the first few episodes. The ending for the season was great and possibly the most shocking ever."
1,3.5,"Personally I'm not into swords and shields, but this one I would recommend."
1,5.0,Best show ever made hands down
1,5.0,"Reasonably similar to the book and one of the best TV shows of all time (seasons 1-4). Sadly after season 4 the show starts to fall down in places, although it only becomes unbearable in seasons 7 & 8."
1,4.5,"Game of Thrones Season One is definitely one of the best tv shows I've ever experienced. Every character is incredible, the cgi holds up, the set design and practical effects are amazing. The writing is perfect aswell. Can't wait to watch season 2! 9.5/10!"
1,4.5,Pretty good start for Game of Thrones.
1,0.5,its worst show ever made it dumb characters lock like pussy its worst show ever made
1,5.0,"Finally a show without those stupid Hollywoodish, PG-13 happy endings. Something serious."
1,5.0,"Great way to start a series, with lots of twist and turns in the amazing universe that George R. R. Martin created."
1,1.5,"Well-acted. Great sets. Great effects. Weak story. Nothing but shock value. (Tries too hard to be like Starz's Spartacus.) Can't believe I wasted my money on the DVD box set without even watching this on TV first! That is because I had cut the cord and did not have HBO. (I partially blame Comcast.) Nice try, but someone from HBO owes me $50 [for the first season box set]."
1,5.0,"Structure, character, and dialogue is brilliant"
1,5.0,The beginning of the amazing story
1,4.5,"I was like most people. I had heard of this show but spent years having no interest in actually watching it. I'm glad I finally gave in. This is one of the greatest stories I've ever watched. The characters are so well developed and I a vested interest in many of them after the first episode. There is plenty of action and suspense, enough to give the TV my undivided attention. This show has so many great actors who do a great job of portraying their characters. I would give the story 5/5, character development a 5/5, action 4/5 and acting 4/5 for an overall score of 4/5."
1,5.0,The most amazing fantasy movie (correction) tv series I have ever watched in my life...First season is flawless and the finale is breathtaking
1,5.0,read the book. excellent start the tale of the Starks. Jaime's push is the boulder that gets the ball rolling.
1,5.0,Best TV Show there is
1,4.0,Every time I rewatch GoT I learn to appreciate the first season more and more. Overall a great setup for the wars to come.
1,3.0,A good show. But Quite stretched at parts. Barely takes time for a Story twist to take place.
1,5.0,As good as TV or film gets.
1,4.5,it is really hard to understand the story in the first time but i am glad that i re-watched it cause this show is lit
1,5.0,"Since the very pilot episode, i think i had a trauma, a good one trauma. The showrunner really knows how to put a bold scenes to engaged the audiences since the beginning, and i'd love to say, until the end of season 1. Eventhough i think the sex scenes was too explicit, i still enjoyed it somehow. Sadly, i can't watch this show with my family since it would have been really awkward if i do."
1,5.0,Best show on TV. top 3 best show of all time
1,5.0,"In the first i wasn`t a lover of Sci-Fi,fantasy or any type of fiction movies and TV-Shows.But after watching the first few episodes of Game Of Thrones,i totally changed my mind."
1,4.5,"With its magnificent spectacle, a widening cast of superb characters and rich lore, Game of Thrones is a fantasy medieval epic with an infectiously addictive bite."
1,5.0,The books where amazing and the show is extremely engaging!
1,5.0,"Unique in its own kind, Game of Thrones biggest asset in a world with dragons and iron thrones is its bold and raw storytelling that defies any conventional narrative arc."
1,5.0,Uma das melhores séries. Abre a primeira temporada com maestria e deixa aquele gosto de quero mais para as próximas temporadas. Cada episodio termina com uma deixa para o próximo. Essa série é simplesmente incrível.
1,5.0,Best Show Ever! This is the best season of them all. I had no idea about the asoiaf books so I went in blind. Love this show!!
1,4.5,"On an alien planet, human-like inhabitants undergoing an iron age contend with imposing and long-lasting summers and winters, all the while contesting each other in medieval ways to secure resources and optimal positions so they, their families and the people can survive."
1,1.0,Adaption: Grade D Faithful of Source: No (Due not having 20 Episodes for Novel 1) Faithful of Characters: No (Due not having 20 Episodes for Novel 1)
1,5.0,"The first season of Game of Thrones definitely gives a great start to an incredible show giving us a bloody but great story of power, war and relationships. Even though it's not suitable for younger viewers and some people might find it a little disturbing, it's definitely a show that gives great writing, direction and performances from the whole cast. The whole cast all do a good job making you either love or hate their character. Overall, it's an incredible start for more amazing seasons after."
1,5.0,The best TV show of all times
1,4.5,"Incredibly well made! Amazing sets, superior acting, unique characters and engaging story. And this is only the prologue!"
1,4.0,"This is seriously such a well written well acted show, the trailer doesn't do it justice, just watch a few episodes, trust me, you'll love it"
1,4.5,Game of thrones gets off to great start with a show that is both well made and continually fascinating.
1,5.0,"Story, Cast, Acting, VFX etc every is Tremendous also Most Realistically Written Series, High Fantasy, Kings, Queen, Wars, White Walker (Snow Monsters) & Dragons... Realism meams nothing blurred or cuted e.g. Sex Scenes & violence Scenes which makes it different from other TV series and Also Amazing & Great TV Series... To the point & close to the book, This TV series is magnificent & Excellent, I Really Liked it Rated 10/10... Regards"
1,4.0,"Well, I'm sure that if I started watching that series with its season one premiere in 2011, I wasn't going to keep watching it! It was so boring as a big series, but fortunately, I was underage, so last year -after I got registered- I bought it. But I got bored, because of season one, then I stopped watching it, and then I watched it again and I loved it! Glad that I didn't miss the 'Game'! Sorry for the long intro. Let's get now to season one of Game of Thrones... I'm a big fan of George R.R. Martin's books, a Song of Ice and Fire! And HBO made a great TV adaption, with the details, performances, scenery, cast, costumes and every-single-thing! HBO's GoT made me love it, more than the books it-selves! But it didn't do that fast, it took 6 episodes to be a routine of mine. After 6 episodes, GoT became something I must do everyday, literately! The slow storytelling in this season, bothered me to hell! 6 episodes with nothing, and then some interesting things in episode 7,,same in episode 8, and then the two saviors of the season, episode 9 and the season finale! That's my only and biggest problem with this season.."
1,4.0,"It may get bogged down in its set up at times, but not only is this unavoidable, it's no big issue. Great characters and a fully-developed world make GoT essential viewing."
1,4.5,"Game Of Thrones kick off the series with an incredible cast, and has some of the best dialogue a series could ask for, and the White Walkers are truly incredible as well. Overall a fantastic start to the best TV series ever created and the adaption of George R.R. Martin A song of Ice and Fire book 1: A Game of Thrones."
1,5.0,best series i like it best adventure series
1,5.0,The best TV series of all time.
1,1.0,"Ugh, this isn't fantasy, it's soap-opera, and not even good soap-opera - lazy melodrama for the small-minded and easily dazzled cable ""drama"" viewer."
1,4.0,"Amazing star cast, storyline, unpredictable, and AMAZING. Politics, Adventure it is all about."
1,5.0,"The best tv series ever. Powerful, with first class acting, and it is both hauntingly fantastical and terribly realistic."
1,5.0,"Before I watched Game of Thrones for the first time, I was not really a fan of the ""middle age"" stories. I watched the first episode and it really caught me. I have to say that the whole scenarios, clothes, the acting and soundtrack is amazing. you first start following each character story and when you realize you are already in the episode 10. I realized why the people keep saying to ""not fall in love with any character"", and i really recommend that again. Each episode lasts aprox. 1 hour and that makes it enjoyable if you are really a fan of watching tv series. i bet that if you see the first season, you will end up watching the whole series and will not even be aware of it, until you are in season 06. this is some work of art we got here and I can say it for every season it has. 10 of 10!"
1,4.5,"Game of Thrones is mid evil time show thats based on a book this show is good with characters love or hate like JOFFREY!!!!!!! but charaters we love like Ned Starke, Tyrion Lannister Daenerys Targaryen and Jon Snow this show is that kind of show that no one is safe and kills some we love off just to give us rage. with 7 kingdoms and a wall of ice ruled by that little idiot JOFFREY god i want him dead and the shows has dragons how cool is that i know i love dragons but the shows no perfect but its still good 9/10"
1,5.0,"The first season of Game Of Thrones is some great ass television. There's no need to elaborate, expect flawlessness in every aspect of the season, especially Sean Bean's performance."
1,4.5,"The best sword & sorcery genre film ever made to date. GRRM's work is accurately portrayed in this adaptation, the cast is great, no bad apples (or ""rotten tomatoes"") in the lot. The story line stays strongly true to Martin's book, character development is excellent, and that leave you on the edge of your seat wondering who is going to survive adds a nice element to the edgy nature of the series. Moreover, the writing is such that I felt torn about whom to be loyal to, since as soon as I got attached to a character they would either die or do something that made me question that loyalty - that makes for very good audience involvement. This season is a winning season and well worth watching."
1,4.0,"Puntaje Original: 8.0 Una escenografía increíble, personajes muy bien trabajados, una trama sumamente intrigante que te tendrá cruelmente expectando a lo que sucederá el próximo capítulo. Game of Thrones tiene todo lo que necesita una serie para atrapar a quien sea a la que se proyecta como una de las mejores series de todos los tiempos."
1,4.5,"Over All the Production Value, Game Of Thrones Offers What Most Of The Series Lacks Nowadays; A Soul. Outstading Performances and Even Tho Slow Paced, Thrilling Storytelling, I'd SayThe Only Reason This Show Wouldn't Capture A Viewer's Attention Would Be The Gory Style It Posses"
1,5.0,"The first book of the series (the only one I've read really) is captured beautifully in this season. I waited a very long time to get on the GOT bandwagon but I'm glad I hoped on! The cast, the cinematography and stories this season delves into is what captivated me from beginning to end. It can only get better, and bloodier, from here."
1,5.0,Nearly everything you want in a TV show is here. This is escapism at its best and you forget you are in the real world when watching it.
1,2.0,primele doua episoade sunt underwhelming. probabil cartile sunt mai bune.
1,5.0,Easily the best TV series ever made.
1,4.5,"Excelente ambientación, buenos personajes y una historia interesante."
1,4.5,I had head about the show and had not see it after i wached the first episoded it got me. this season had a really good drawn and made me want to see more and i could not wait for the next epsiode.
1,4.5,Looking back and re-watching the Pilot and season 1 HBO really was clever setting out the white walkers and then pull them back for 4 seasons and kept us really curious. AMAZING GAME OF THRONES TACTICS HBO
1,5.0,"If you have read the books you will not be disappointed. Very true to the original message. Great acting, magical dwarf, who could ask for more in escapism?"
1,5.0,"What a beautiful portrait of imagination that completely engulfs all feelings, senses and emotions. A story you never want to end."
1,5.0,This show has by far been the best show I have ever watched. The story line is amazing. The actors go perfectly well with what their roles are. Even though Cersei is a bitch Lena plays her wonderfully. I will hate to see it end.
1,2.0,"More darkness, disturbing sex and senseless violence. Way to make the world a better place."
1,5.0,"So far, this is my favorite season. I enjoy watching where and how the events took place. We vaguely know about the characters and relations, but from this season alone, we learn about who we can trust, distrust, hate and love."
1,4.0,"Game of Thrones: Season 1 Game of Thrones is an amazing adaptation from beloved George R. R. Martin fantasy. pure, intimate, and definitely has a compelling distinctive depth."
1,5.0,"This is one of those rare occasions where something really popular is actually really good, in terms of quality that is. The never ending intricate details of the story and screenwriting are every bit as compelling as everything else about this show. A definite must watch for anyone who has the patience for it."
1,5.0,This series is one of the cases in my life where I ask myself? Where was I all that time to just see the BEST SERIES EVER only in 2017!
1,4.5,"This first season of Game of Thrones has aged well. As an introduction to characters who will become fond staples for discussion, as well as to the show's trend of killing off such beloved characters, this season was quite strong. The CGI used was very effective, performances were more or less strong all around, and the locales are gorgeous. Certainly, there are a few moments where action scenes appear to have aged somewhat less well than those from later seasons, but the show's primary charm is not in those fighting scenes; it's in the show's script, In this first season, with casting choices and script choices that stuck fairly closely to the important aspects of the books, the show made safe and intelligent choices that kept characters feeling grounded and real. Sure, there was gratuitous nudity, but that is an easy mistake to make when one is on HBO. Overall, I anticipate I'll be going back to this series years in the future. I strongly recommend it."
1,4.5,"Everything about this fantasy series is spectacular. It's well-acted, excellently written and true to the book. The plot twists at just the right times, keeping viewers engaged."
1,4.5,"Fresh, innovative, and above all intrigue. 95/100."
1,5.0,"'Game of Thrones' season 1 is a brilliant adaptation of the gruesome, violating and very complex world of George R.R. Martin's 'A Game of Thrones'. The first book of seven in the book series 'A Song of Ice & Fire'."
1,5.0,"This show is a thrilling roller-coaster ride, with so many twists and unexpected events. Every episode brings something new to the table and it is so good. To anyone waiting out on this show... Go watch it. Believe me it's worth it. I cant wait to see what the rest of this show brings! My score for Game of Thrones: 10/10 (My review is for the entire series)"
1,4.5,"The season that captures completely ""A song of Ice and Fire"" essence."
1,5.0,Later seasons improve the show but this is a start of a legendary piece of television.
1,5.0,"I am absolutely obsessed with this show. I can't get enough. I have watched season 1 - 6, twice and will be watching them again, before season 7 comes out. The first book, is now on it's way, too. The best show ever made."
1,4.5,"Gripping, Exciting and keeps you hooked"
1,4.5,"I've been caught, every episode makes you wanna watch the next one and so on."
1,5.0,"A friend of mine introduced me to the books before the show went into production, so I was well aware of this series before it premiered. However, I was a bit turned off by the number of pages and small writing that the first book, A Game of Thrones, was published with. I did enjoy the book for the most part, but most of the time I had no idea what was going on. There were too many characters and storylines to keep track of. So, with mixed emotions of desiring to finish the book and losing interest at points, it took me about a year to read the entire first novel. And I knew that one day I would have to pick up the second book because I don't like leaving a story unfinished. A couple of years later, the show premiered in the spring of 2011 and I was immediately hooked. I remembered most of the book and I was amazed by how well adapted the show was to the story. Now that I was able to put faces to the characters, I understood the stories more and finally realized what a milestone the series was for both TV and literature. The first season follows the first book perfectly. It even begins with the book's prologue, about three members of the Night's Watch that go out beyond the Wall and are attacked by mysterious beings that the book calls the ""Others"". However the show has changed their name to the ""White Walkers"". The entire series is well cast, with very promising child actors playing the Stark children; plus the landscapes and set pieces look positively breathtaking. It really makes you feel like this is a historical land. Though there is a lot of nudity and gore, the show hits home with everything it has to offer. I cannot praise this show enough and I look forward to the upcoming seasons. In the meantime, I think I'll pick up the next book."
1,5.0,"The opening season of Game Of Thrones delivers the strong characterisation and thrills of the novel, while adding an excellent cinematic flare and superb performances from a very talented cast, giving fans exactly what they asked for. Violent and vulgar, what else would we want? Verdict: A+"
1,4.5,"""Winter is coming."" So says Eddard Stark, nobleman and ruler, father and husband, warrior and hand to the king. He says it with a sense of the inevitable, with grief and a heavy heart. And he says it with conviction, something that permeates every aspect of Game of Thrones. More than the best new series of 2011, it's one of the finest shows to grace television, and we're only one season in."
1,5.0,the best thing ive ever seen.... ^_^
1,4.0,Really solid first season with only a few missteps. I still think the first episode was...well...rather boring. But it only got better and better from there. I'm hooked.
1,3.5,its good but there are unnecessary things for the beginning of the TV show
1,5.0,"A great start to a series. Season one wonderfully sets everything up - but my fear, based on the reactions I'm hearing about season 8, is that set-up is all George R. R. Martin & co do with this show."
1,4.5,"Intricate, complex, and emotionally enthralling, the first season of Game of Thrones establishes the instantly immersive world of George R. R. Martin with brutal realities about the politics of ruling and careful attention to detail"
1,5.0,"Great adaptation, great performances. It's so well made anyone can see it even if they haven't read the books."
1,5.0,"While not as incredible as S02-S04, this is still one of the best seasons ever brought to TV. The only downside was it had to introduce so many characters and plotlines and complicated history that it didn't have as much time for thos characters to shine. But nonetheless it was easily a 5 star season even when compared to all the other exceptional shows on TV."
1,4.0,"Puntaje Original: 8.0 Una escenografía increíble, personajes muy bien trabajados, una trama sumamente intrigante que te tendrá cruelmente expectando a lo que sucederá el próximo capítulo. Game of Thrones tiene todo lo que necesita una serie para atrapar a quien sea a la que se proyecta como una de las mejores series de todos los tiempos."
1,3.5,"slow season but good near the ending half of the season, could have had more story elements from the books"
1,5.0,this is some amazing stuff.
1,4.5,"Five years later, revisiting where it all started is strange. In a way, it seems like yesterday when, in 2011, I sat down to watch ""Winter Is Coming"". Every year since has dominated fans with when the new season will start. In retrospect, the first season of Game of Thrones is like a wine that is yet to be fine wine. This is one of the most realistic fantasies in terms of storytelling and making a fictional world seem real. Unlike most fantasies where you know the protagonist will pull through, Thrones has at least five major protagonists in Season 1 and nobody is safe. Anyone could die at any moment as it is in real war, although the Seven Kingdoms and the Baratheon Dynasty are ruling in peace at the start. What flaws Season 1 has is mostly in pacing. Yes, the first half of the season can come off as slow, I will admit that. You wonder how Eddard Stark will fulfill his role as the Hand of the King, what threat really has The Night's Watch in controlled turmoil, and how Viserys and Daenerys Targaryen can possibly hope to reclaim Westeros and restore House Targaryen when the Usurper rules in relative peace. However, this peace it thrown out the window, never to fully return when a poorly judged suspect captured for an attempted Stark murder sets the Westerlands and the Riverlands at each-others throats, and a rash, poorly thought out coup leads to total and irreversible war due to an execution which should never have been. Game of Thrones Season 1 is in truth a mixed blessing. Yes, it doesn't really hold up well in terms of pacing compared to the rest of the series, and yes the first six episodes are slow. But a redemption does come in episode 7 onwards when a lot of the Game of Thrones traditional qualities the show possesses blossom into formation as the Iron Throne becomes highly sought after. If one has even a casual liking for fantasy and can sit through the first seven episodes without getting entirely bored, this show will suit you well. A true and faithful adaption of A Song Of Ice And Fire."
1,5.0,1st eps suck then rest great
1,4.0,Sean Bean muriendo... acaso nadie lo vio venir :v
1,0.5,Most boring TV season of any show created.
1,5.0,Amazing first season.. A classic in the making
1,5.0,"Too much unnecessary nudity, but the story telling is too beautiful to veer you away from it."
1,4.5,"The first episode is not as strong as many of the season openers and feels like it was trying to half wrap things up from last season. It eventually picks up immediately and the schemes, the plots, the intrigue and action follow expectations. Yet another season of great television. http://www.watchfulltvseries.com/Watch-Game-of-Thrones-Online.html"
1,5.0,Game of Thrones is the best thing TV has to offer and this season started it all off with a bang.
1,4.5,"With the debut season of ""Game of Thrones"", Benioff and Weiss have managed to kick-off a groundbreaking, brilliant, and wholly unique TV series in spectacular fashion. The convoluted story lines are each given proper weight and are perfectly interwoven among each other, presenting the dense plot and expansive amount of characters and locations with great clarity. On top of this, the top-level cinematic production value on display is the mesmerizing icing on the cake to a narrative TV series unlike anything ever brought to the television medium."
1,4.0,"So much has happened since Season 1 and it's funny that I see it as a disappointment compared to the majesty of Seasons 3,4 and 5 but I still love it. It introduces you to the brutality of the world you are about to fall in love with. The characters you will loath and want to risk your own life for. It shows you that the exact thing you believe would never happen can happen. That is Game of Thrones and season 1 is pretty mild compared to the others."
1,5.0,Only bad thing about first season was that sean bean was in it and we already knew what would happen :(
1,3.5,He (Sean Bean) had to die here again :P
1,3.5,"Good, but don't have a good dose of blood."
1,5.0,"Fantastic start to a really high-praised series. Game of Thrones carefully evokes the viewer with its strong themes, characters and happenings. Definitely one to check out. Wonderful drama."
1,4.0,"La mejor serie que he visto. Los mejores actores, la mejor historia: Una serie muy bien elaborada. La historia de esta magnífica serie es impresionante. Muestra gran realidad del mundo humano, en donde todo es injusto. Se las recomiendo 100%."
1,5.0,"Wow, I held out for a long time before watching GOT but it blew me away. I binge watched the first three seasons in a couple weeks. One of the greatest stories ever told and destined to become a classic."
1,4.5,"Intriguing Story Settings, Well Acted and Smartly Written, Game of Thrones has a neat, fresh start actually."
1,5.0,"Good gosh, how good can a show be. Game of Thrones has an incredible story, and outstanding characters. I finally found a show that is better than The Walking Dead, Ii will continue watching this show to the final season because it's incredible."
1,5.0,one of the greatest tv series of all time
1,5.0,"One of the best seasons ever for a TV show. The definition of starting with a bang. Wowzers. Will have you screaming, chearing, pulling out your hair and throwing something at your screen... likely all within a few minutes... over and over and over again."
1,5.0,"Beautifully acted, visually stunning, thrilling, smartly written, and powerfully dramatic"
1,3.0,"Perhaps I was unfair in my initial review and rating. I only caught a handful of episodes. Those I did see appeared well done. The show appears to do justice to the books, which I've read. While very suspenseful, the books are chock full of violence and depravity. You keep wanting to find out what happens next; you're hoping for a good outcome for your favorite characters, but a happy ending for anyone seems quite elusive. This series is about an endless struggle for survival, with so many characters who seem to deserve better dying violently. Game of Thrones has some beautiful actors and actresses in a detailed medieval fantasy setting. A lot of attention to detail went into making this epic series come to life on screen. The mysterious gods in this are competing against each other. Some of them seem relatively benign but weak, and some of them are reanimating the dead. So, this violent medieval fantasy world gradually moves toward a zombie apocalypse, which is a bonus for people who are fans of both medieval fantasy AND zombies, although the focus remains on the living heroes, heroines, and villains."
1,4.5,Una vez que empiezas a ver esta serie no hay manera de que no te guste.
1,4.5,"Game of Thrones' first season is often misunderstood and given negative feedback. The first season isn't packed with action and killing, although there's still enough of it. We, the viewers, are being dragged into the realm alongside the characters that we're beginning to fall in love with. There is a lot to take in and the story is told in an undoubtedly perfect way. Although it is not the best season of all 5, the first season is still thrilling and exciting to watch."
1,4.5,A great prologue to the mysterious and bloody world of Westeros and beyond.
1,4.0,Lot better than I expected it to be...
1,5.0,"mostly pretty accurate book to show transition, all important arcs included"
1,4.5,"A really good first season introduces us to GRRM's world of Westeros which is full of politcal plots, love, ambition and war."
1,3.0,"Game of Thrones season 1 is really original, unpredictable and its visual effects are magically dazzling, but talking about the interest we can say it is a zero at the left, to not talk about of its excess of characters that won't please the spectator in the first episodes of this season, and all of this make as this series has more fame than the gold that it promises."

1,4.0,"I have not had the pleasure of reading the books however, it seems that the series sticks close to them according to other reviews. It can seem drawn out in some episodes but with so much to cover I can see the challenges. Overall it is a stunning masterpiece with something to grab your attention each episode. I love how the opening sequence is somewhat interactive in that it keeps up with what is going on in the story line. For me, it is the best opening sequence in a long time. If you love fantasy and I am a big fan of fantasy, you couldn't ask for more. Well, maybe just to see those awesome dragons fully grown finally! I can't wait, what a spectacular series."
1,4.5,"I am a big fan of the book series, but was hesitant to see the show. After all, the books are always better than the adaptation, anyway, and I generally stay away from gratuitous nudity. However, the story is too good not to see played out. Because of the spoiler-riffic nature of the show, I will speak in general terms. There is a lot of intrigue, cool plot points, fantastical locations, and fleshed-out characters. People die, sometimes unexpectedly, and the pace really picks up about mid-season. There is some mighty fine acting, and some decent one-liners (the lions share coming from Peter Dinklages excellent portrayal of Tyrion Lannister). While the books are better, the show does condense it down to a more digestible amount."
1,5.0,"It's sometimes odd to go back and see how everything was at the beginning. This was the one season that set everything up for future events in the series, and it was all crafted with skill and rock solid source material. Not one bad performance from the (quite big) entire cast. This season really showed us the vast universe of the franchise, as well as its harsh nature. You won't forget THAT beheading anytime soon."
1,5.0,"Game of Thrones first season is a great, well-acted, smartly written drama."
1,4.0,"The first season of Game of Thrones is exceptional, but lacks the heart of a fantasy drama."
1,4.5,"A series that grips your attention with it's storytelling, the way it was filmed, the way the actors performed- this is a show to appreciate on television."
1,5.0,Absolutely amazing!!!!
1,5.0,"Featuring excellent characters and good writing the show has a very good first season. That being said, it deteriorates sharply after season one. A very unusual periodical action drama, featuring both a fantasy realm as well as unknown supernatural horrors has immense potential. And the first season really does live up to the potential in full. A superb team of actors makes the unique characters come alive and draw the viewer in. Even the kids are very identifiable, just mature enough to be interesting, yet appropriately childish and naive when necessary. Peter Dinklage is simply amazing, surely the best on the show. Maisie Williams, Emilia Clarke and Sophie Turner also must be mentioned as they make a big impact towards making an excellent début season. Politics in a middle aged setting would not be the best subject for a TV series perhaps, yet here, mixed with drama and fuelled with action that concept actually works. The characters are very well rounded and quite a few of them are identifiable, a principal that is crucial to the success of such a show. Here it is not very easy to distinguish concepts of good and bad from one another. With quite a few controversial subjects you may find yourself liking some characters and hating others, and your friend may feel the exact opposite. That is another aspect which makes the show worth watching. Seeing a 13th century European culture and a Bronze Age eastern tribe on the same screen is a bit bizarre, yet like most bizarre things in this series it actually works out fine, adding to the story. Writing is good, and an elaborate story like this one may be a bit hard to follow, but it is fascinating nonetheless, throughout the vast majority of the season. A solid A is a fitting grade for this season, yet not the following ones."
1,3.0,"Have people out there really understood that its the whole season you should rate, not the awesome title-sequence? Because it's overrated with its big focus on characters and over-scripted dialogs. The show didnt look action-packed or great; those were my expectations. That hypothesis did look trustworthy during the first five episodes, but the show truly escalated greatly after that. To explain why this first season of the over-popular fantasy show called Game of Thrones only deserves a 6/10 we must split the season in two parts (ep 1-5 & 6-10). My first impressions were like this; its beautifully shot and we have wonderful characters. But whats going on? Theres really nothing happening. Boring dialogs, a not impressive story, too much character introductions at the same time and no action at all. Thats mostly what the first five episodes got. Theres really nothing interesting going on; sure the show do need a solid plot to continue developing, but its so boring. Some of the episodes do have better and more interesting stories than other, but its overall extremely boring with all the over-scripted dialogs and lack of action. Lets continue with the other half. The plot is much more interesting and I really got closer to the characters. Therere even some minor intensity in form of action in some of the episodes. Unpredictable events is also another great aspect, but the show is still slow even though it got some great parts. The second half of this first season of Game of Thrones is much better than the first, much more excitement and I really got to feel the great chemistry that truly defines the show. As the show keeps going; I get to know the characters more and more, I get closer to them and that makes med enjoy the story more, even though its almost as less interesting as in the first five episodes. The actors are all very talented and they all play their roles with passion. Emilia Clarke might be the only actor I got problems with. She doesnt play her role that great when shes under pressure. Shes too serious. But other than that are all characters and actors stunning; they all look real and they are greatly visualized. The hole show really is visually stunning (even though the CGI is vague sometimes) with wide storytelling that also is very unpredictable. The show tries hard to become something extraordinary, and it is on the way, but it totally fails when it comes to action and long-term entertainment. The show got as mentioned; both great and less great aspects. The episodes gets better throughout this first season and they really did become okay to watch in the season finale. The best aspect of the show though, must be the title-sequence; its so awesome and inspirational with its touching music. But Im a bit disappointed when it comes to the music in the show, it could have been much more powerful and touching as in the title-sequence. But its still great, and I do understand why so many out there likes this show so much; all these deep and relatable characters are incredible. But the story is too focused on the characters rather than on the bigger picture; to develop the story! But it begins to feel like all these character introductions and slower storytelling might pay off in the future, well it better be if Im going to give a higher rating! I would for sure give the second half of this first season of Game of Thrones a 7, because its much more entertaining, interesting and intense. But Game of Thrones truly is an overrated tv-show (so far), even though it got its great parts. But the story really need to develop more, not continue on this slower and characteristic boring path. My overall rating for each episode is 6.47/10. 6/10"
1,4.0,A fantastic start to the series which grabs you and doesn't let go.
1,3.5,"7.0/10 — ""Pretty Good/Engaging"" -(Seen in JAN '21)"
1,4.5,"Initially I was skeptical about this series but after a friends recommended it to me I got hook. Season 1 was excellent in the way it tells the story of each character, the acting was superb and the set was incredible. It was unlike anything we've seen and that's what made this series good."
1,5.0,"www.rottentomatoes.com/tv/game-of thrones/s01/ in even years after their entry of then,for producks known reasons,they begin to produce extensive and irreversible damage on avaible at offices,a person of the word public-health agencies."
1,4.5,"Little matters its problems with sexposition and the slow pace of the first episodes, since 'Game of Thrones' triumphs in its first season in almost every other level thanks to its magnificent scope, the cast outstanding performances (with Sean Bean, Lena Headey, Peter Dinklage and Emilia Clarke standing out), its production aspects and its faithfulness to George R. R. Martin's original work. Best episodes: 'Winter is Coming (01)', 'A Golden Crown (06)' and 'Baelor (09)'"
1,5.0,"This is such a good show. I don't know much about the Game of Thrones story. I had never even heard of the books when I started watching the show, let alone read any of them So people might ask why did I watch the show. It wasn't because of postive reviews like most who didn't read the books. I will give anything a shot that HBO or Showtime put out right now. Both of them just have such a reputation for great TV."
1,4.5,"Acting is impeccable, especially compared to TV's laxer standards. The plotline is clever and intricate, though a dull pace can occasionally bore viewers for temporary lapses."
1,5.0,"This season is a masterpiece, never mind the limited budget, HBO created a truly piece of television history"
1,5.0,I am so glad I finally started watching Game of Thrones even though I shouldn't be allowed to because it's emotionally wrecking me. I just love it!
1,5.0,An impressive amount of work has gone into Game of Thrones and the result is a quality fantasy drama.
1,5.0,"The Death of Ned Stark was what get me hooked. Not that I want him to die, but I considered him a main character. Any other story would have found a way to keep him alive. His death shocked me, in a good way. This is the first story that shows that it's not afraid of killing anyone. There is no plot armor. This keeps me on the edge everytime my favorite characters are in a dangerous situation."
1,5.0,As good as serial television gets.
1,5.0,"It might not have all the flare of the books, but it certainly captures the tension. The betrayal. The vile, and the righteous personalities all intermingled together. I so very much love the slow build to the fantasy element of this show, combined with the drama, and fondness that you find yourself feeling for some of the most unlikable people. I suggest everyone give this show a try. At least a few episodes. If you don't love it by then, you never will."
1,4.0,Season 1 made me fall in love with the series.
1,5.0,"Easily gets you hooked from the first episode. The amazing writing, characters and directing makes it one of the best shows on TV."
1,4.0,"Very exciting show, and I know they just get better as the seasons progress. Wonderful characters to follow in their journey. Some room for improvement, hence just the 4/5 score, but I know they'll get there to that top spot."
1,4.5,Game of Thrones is a captivating and exquisitely produced depiction of a fantasy world which rivals the best shows on television.
1,5.0,"Everything right about screenwriting for television. Deep, intricate characters with overwhelming visual beauty and twisted plot lines that leave you breathless."
1,4.5,"Game of Thrones presents many stories connected in one gigantic world, that hook the viewer with it's excellent story telling and some good acting."
1,5.0,Best tv series ever....
1,4.0,Sean Bean is in this. Can you guess what happens to his character?
1,4.0,"Full of impressive spectacle and compelling characters, Game of Thrones's first season lives up to all expectations."
1,4.5,"Game of Thrones is a really addictive show which highlights amazing acting, writing, visual effects, and directing. Sean Bean, Lena Headey, Iain Glen, Mchelle Fairley and Peter Dinklage did great jobs."
1,4.5,The first season of Game of Thrones is a fantastic start and well developed and constructed. The story slowly unfolds with many twits and turns that leave the audience wanting more. The characters are well developed . Score: 9.4/10
1,5.0,"King Robert Baratheons royal hand dies leading him to ask his old friend, Eddard Stark from the North, to come to his kingdom and serve as the hand. His family is reluctant to move, so some stay behind. When Stark arrives, it is quite obvious there is much deceit behind the king, the king just doesnt know how much. The Kings wife, Cersei, is cheating on the king, with her brother, and if Stark discover this and their other webs of lies, Cerseis bloodline may be cut out of the kingdom. How will the Starks get along in the kingdom and deal with all of the scandals? I am a huge Game of Thrones fan and truly feel this is the greatest television series ever created. From the first episode of the handing out of the wolves, to the final episode of season four, everything is well thought-out, written, and delivered. The sets and scenery are amazing and top level movie quality good. This is a must see series! Grade: A+"
1,4.0,"Really takes you in a different world.. The story, characters, scenes everything is amazing.. its a very fair, fiction but too mundane.. perfect!"
1,4.0,"There's a lot of chitchat in the first few episodes, but all in all, the first season of ""Game of Thrones"" is a dark, exciting, and well-acted TV show. In the end, you will be looking forward to the second season."
1,2.0,"Though not without its merits in select plot lines, Game of Thrones mostly drags itself out beyond a reasonable running time."
1,4.5,I rly got thrown into this thing. Its awesome!
1,4.0,"This adaptation of George R.R. Martin's mythical tale is grand and mystic. Even though those who do not follow the eerie and fantastical theme may not catch on, Game of Thrones Season 1 has enough violence, drama, exploitation and splendor to surprise audiences. 4/5"
1,5.0,The final episode was one of the most striking and strange scenes when I watched it. Really fascinating show.
1,4.5,"Featuring hollywood blockbuster production values and great performances, Game of Thrones is a loyal adaption of the novel which loyally adapts the source material."
1,5.0,"A very good start. Basically a reminder that this show is anything but predictable. Favorite Episodes: 9, 10."
1,1.5,"Well there was 10 hours of my life I'll never get back. This is simply the most boring and slowly paced show I have watched since ""The Walking Dead"". This, in my opinion, the the bastard son of ""Spartacus: Blood and Sand"" and ""House of Cards"" with a bit of a fantasy element thrown in. I hate politics so watching a bunch of people jockying to get in a place of power or plotting and scheming to get more power...it just bores me. Power hungry people aren't interesting. There's violence and blood but no more than ""Braveheart"" or the above mentioned ""Spartacus"". A few boobs, a penis here or there, 1 gay couple and a bit of lesbianism but that isn't enough to titilate. All in all, I found this a complete waste of time."
1,4.5,"With just enough of everything we all want to see at its best: fantasy, swords, conflicts, kingdoms, nudity, blood, actual characters to care for and memorable, the first season of Game of Thrones starts the adaptation strongly, with its cockteases for the next season assuring it can only get better. Not every episode is better than the previous one, but manages to fix everything when it does. A great start for this fantasy epic. Not even in TV Sean Bean escapes death, damn it..."
1,4.5,Game of Thrones debuts with an immediately gripping and complex -- although occasionally perfunctory -- fantasy story that is brilliantly woven together with a slew of deeply crafted characters.
1,4.0,"It's easier to appreciate looking back now that we've begun to see how the events that this season set up are beginning to unfold. Game of Thrones' premiering season's main weakness is the fact that it introduces such a vast array of characters that are difficult to keep track of to you all at once. But once you've learned their names and gotten to know their personalities, the rest of the series flows like a charm."
1,5.0,"An excellent fantasy show with a great cast, Game of Thrones is also a compelling study of politics and human ambition."
1,4.0,"Amazing adaptation of the political fantasy novel by George R.R. Martin. The pace might seem a little slow at first, but soon enough, the well scripted events and colorful characters will get you hooked."
1,5.0,"A wonderful mythos which strives not just to be at par with the source material, but to enrich it."
1,4.0,Great!!! Looking forward to watch the second season.
1,4.0,"I kinda guess a certain death when I saw Sean Bean. But still, this season gets me on the hook."
1,4.5,"Confusing story line. Nerve wracking characters. Endless twists. Oddly honest pictures. Might be overwhelming for some people, but impressive for the rest."
1,5.0,"A tremendous achievement in television that was far better than even my lofty expectations. For all the gorgeous scenery and action, what enthralled me most was the dialogue, words like battle that occasionally reach the high bar set by ""The Lion in Winter."" There is a very fine line here between an attempt to empower women and to exploit them as objects. The series seems to want to have it both ways, but it also occasionally does the same with men. There is diversity here, but the setting is a misogynistic world that is undergoing tremendous change in a short amount of time. What is commentary and what is gratuitous? It is difficult to tell. I'm eager to read the book to see how the source material deals with these fine lines."
1,3.5,"Takes a while to become compelling, but once the king dies, the series becomes addictive and fascinating, benefiting from gorgeous cinematography, great performances, and an air of dread."
1,4.5,"A very engaging world and storyline with interesting characters, even if the plot is a bit difficult to follow with its complexity."
1,4.5,A great way to start off a great TV series. Is one of the most well written TV shows of all time. Has amazing performances and the story is very interesting. You'll be addicted almost instantly.
1,5.0,"excellent series a must see series that will not let you down, it draws you to the next episode. watch this"
1,5.0,"I generally do not watch tv because almost all of it is lazy, unoriginal, and often awful. Game of Thrones couldn't be further from any of those things. After I finished the first episode, I was immediately hooked because it has everything I could possibly want in a tv show: political intrigue, fantasy elements, a fleshed out world, interesting plot and characters, good production, writing, acting, and directing, and a willingness to take risks. Game of Thrones is officially the first, and potentially only, tv show that I absolutely need to watch as soon as it airs."
1,4.0,"Boobs, wieners and massive amounts of violence... Sadly, no dragons, yet. Yeah, that about sums it up. The acting is decent and the dialogue is medieval enough, but it's the show's cutthroat personality that keeps it so intriguing. Reviewed 5/27/14. Rated 4 out of 5."
1,4.5,"In the first season of HBO's Game Of Thrones, it takes awhile to set up all of the characters and all of the settings, but they do a fantastic job of not overly explaining it, but instead just jumping into the action and letting us catch up as it goes. The acting is fantastic and the production value unmatched on television. The plot-lines do progress fairly slowly, but the advantage of a first season is that that can happen since we're still learning who the characters are. This is an incredible show that all fantasy fans will love."
1,4.5,"I read the book, and I LOVE IT. If I loved the book, it was obvious that I was going to like the serie. Now I need to finish reading the second one so I can continue watching it."
1,5.0,This show is absolutely amazing! So much suspense and great acting all around!
1,5.0,"Such a grand epic I am pleased to watch, unputdownable, unforgettable. Events are in so flowing sequence, it appears I am part of it. Every episode was mind blowing and boggling too. Alan taylor's direction was best. Lovely character was Arya, I want a daughter like her just like her."
1,5.0,"Shocking, brutal, and brilliant."
1,5.0,The main reason some people dont like GOT is that there are lot of stories which run in parallel. Those who do not see it carefully tend to get confused. This is the main reason that this great series is under appreciated by critics.
1,4.5,"A remarkably accessible and engrossing saga of families who will stop at nothing for power. Rich, vibrant characters, and a storyline that couldn't be better-paced."
1,5.0,"The story is intricately plotted, the mythical setting is richly detailed with fantastic production design and intriguing lore and the dark, complex characters are brilliantly played by their respective performers."
1,5.0,"Brilliantly written, terrifically acted, intriguing, shocking, dark, violent, foul mouthed and sexy! It's pretty much everything you could want from a TV show except there's a whole lot more to it than just that. Certainly one of the best shows on TV, if not the best show on TV."
1,4.0,A intriguing start of another HBO series that found itslef a large fan base due to it's wonderful plot and actors' performance.
1,2.0,7 episodes in and I'm still waiting for something to happen. It has a strange lackluster in action and overflow of explicit skinemax sex scenes instead of the reverse. Nothing fantasy or magical like has happens at all yet with the exception of revealing fossilized dragon eggs.. wow. I'm done. two stars for the boobs.
1,5.0,"Carefully woven, delightfully dark, and pervasively bloody Game of Thrones actually matches all of its hype"
1,4.5,"With talks of wizards, dragons and evil that lurks beyond the shadows, HBO's Game of Thrones sounds like it could be placed right next to J.R.R. Tolkien's The Lord of the Rings and be right at home. Not so much. Yes, word is spoken of the abovementioned fantasy-genre tropes throughout Season 1's ten episodes, but Game of Thrones is more like The Godfather of fantasy, where the politics of the family business takes precedent over more trivial things like the concept of good or evil. Sean Bean stars as the noble and constant ""Ned"" Stark, who must maneuver his way through power struggle and double-crossing as the King's Hand. As Ned discovers more secrets of his hierarchal kingdom, the more we are intrigued to find the next one out. Characters are thread in and out of a constantly interchanging plot like a piece of clockwork, promising a more grand narrative to come. Perfectly paired to the written word is a truly cinematic (big screen) experience to round the epic nature and scope of the story out. As the sword comes thrusting down and the realization hits that Season 1 is coming to a close, one can hope that Season 2 can live up to its royal name."
1,5.0,"BEST SHOW EVER ON TELEVISION PERIOD!!!!! There is a TON of nudity and violence. I fast forward through the nudity, I wish they didn't put that in the movie. It makes it very very very ""R"" rated. I would not let my kids watch it. I totally GEEK out over the books."
1,4.0,"Game of thrones starts off with a high note, delivering us a engaging story, great drama, and some well written dialogue and dram throughout the season. With it setting the bar as one of the best Television shows in history, and giving us some sense of drama and tension from episode to episode, it is everything that fans of this genre should enjoy."
1,4.5,All Hail to the Khaleesi !!!
1,5.0,An epic start to the greatest show on TV.
1,5.0,"WOW, what an amazing start to a great television series! The characters felt so real, the show has great production values, cool fight scenes, and a intriguing story."
1,5.0,"The best piece of television I ever saw, there's not even a close second. It's epic, it's surprising, it's beautiful to watch, it's well acted, well written and well executed. A work of art by any possible standpoint."
1,5.0,"Spectacular: Wow! This is a thrill ride of awesome story, acting, characters, themes, and violence. The story is so complex (thanks to the source material), but also so well developed. All the characters have so much depth and complexity. Unpredictability at its greatest. The script is great. The visual work is great. The sets and costumes are great. Everything lends itself to the believability of this medieval world. This show is so good I can say it is in the same league as The Lord of the Rings (TV style). I've gain another old world I can daydream about when I'm in class."
1,4.0,"83% Game of Thrones is a television series that I would always like to remember for the sharp dialogues and unpredictable twists. I couldn't stop watching this series once I began it. Game of Thrones is a series that has a complex narrative, it provides some fantasy elements here and there, but they are almost nullified by the muddled politics in the series. Another reason for which this series has to be remembered is for the amount of nudity that it withholds and I must say that I did enjoy it. The only bad thing I feel about this series is that it seems to be written by utter sadists. In Game of Thrones, you don't have the liberty to feel any sort of an attachment with any characters because you can't know when the would bring an awful twist and kill this particular character with good character development. This season was good till the 9th episode and by the end of the 9th episode, it spat out an obnoxious and offensive twist and spoiled all the fun. Also the ending episode failed to reach the heights of the rest of the episodes."
1,4.5,"Going into Game of Thrones is a bit complicated. You must realise at first that the story arc is huge and you shouldn't think about Seasons to conclude the stories. Everything is part of the bigger picture and you'll have shocking twists at every turn. It's also confusing to absorb all the families and thousands of characters that populate this world, but once you absorb everything, it's television at it's very best. Also, props not only to the author and creators for having such a vicious world for women but that somehow, they manage to dominate with cunning and very strong character. Maybe the nudity should've been a bit more biased, I know the female audience of the series wants to see some extra male buttocks and wieners here and there. Feels like men always get the best treats and it's unfair, since you have great and sexy characters at every turn."
1,4.0,"Game of Thrones is not only one of the best fantasy worlds ever created, it's one of the best shows ever put on screen. Its dark humor and themes may turn away some viewers, but attract others. The show also features one of the best assembled cast put on screen."
1,4.5,"For a Tv series of Season 1, It was one of the best ever. Lot of amazing work and a perfect end to wait for second season. Loved it"
1,5.0,HBO hit it out of the park with this show. George Martin turned down Hollywood because he wanted his stories to be given the time to tell and HBO has done that with production values that appear near big screen level. Performances are all superb particularly Sean Bean as Ned Stark. While the series has magic elements and mythology they take a back seat to political manipulation and the corrupting nature of power and how to achieve it and keep it. Its also a show where nobody is safe and the good guys don't always win (in fact they usually don't). For a show set in a fantasy world it is more realistic in its outcomes than any show I've seen. All around make it a fantastic show if you can stand its often extreme violence and incredibly dark places it goes
1,5.0,"I rarely read fiction books anymore, but I'm reading this book because its sooo good."
1,4.5,"Upon it's air-date, it was hard to envision that an R-rated fantasy series would prove successful on American televisionboy were we all wrong. Game of Thrones quickly shot to super-stardom, bringing in both fans of the source material (the book series A Song of Ice and Fire by George R.R. Martin) while also establishing new legions of fans in the process. The key to the show's success, however, was not so much in it's mature take on a well-worn genre, but how it gave us fully-formed characters, a complex yet not over-whelming storyline, and a sense of darkness and menace that is rarely seen in most other tv dramas. A fantastic first season, and every bit the success that it deserves to be."
1,3.0,"Good, but you really need to read the books."
1,5.0,My most favourite TV program on tv today is GAME OF THRONES. Only after watching the 1st season that I bought all the books by GEORGE.R.R.MARTIN... FIRE AND ICE.
1,4.5,A series of cinematic masterpieces!
1,4.5,"At first glance, it seems like Lord of the Rings for adults, but Game of Thrones is so much more than that."
1,5.0,One of the best TV shows ever made.
1,4.5,"This was an excellent first season. The world is beautiful, everyone acts superbly, and the story is absolutely fantastic. I would say that the pacing is a bit slow, but that's just because much of the first season sets up the series as a whole. However, this is balanced by a firm grasp on the fine elements of story telling."
1,5.0,"Hooked, snared, let the story continue! Love the characters, the elements, themes, sub-plots and thematic moments compounding upon each other in this very rich visual and audio experience."
1,5.0,"This story really surprised me - everything about it attracted me, it so intriguing! The various cultures, theirs stories, their accoutrements, traditions, plots, personalities of characters, and the landscape!! Very good acting & directing, i will add! I didn't read the books yet, but I will, perhaps soon as ...Winter is coming!"
1,5.0,WOWWOWWOWWOWWOWWOWWOWWOWWOWWOWWOWWOWWOWWOWWOWWOWWOWW!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
1,5.0,"Immersive, exciting, shocking and intelligent. Game of Thrones is everything a television drama strives to be!"
1,4.0,"Game of Thrones, leaves out the fantasy of this fantasy which makes it way more connected to viewers. Which help to make Game of Thrones very entertaining , plus it contains an excellent cast"
1,4.5,Three episodes in and I'm hooked. A full review will come upon completion of the first season.
1,4.5,"Great first season, but damn I was sad to see Ned Stark go."
1,5.0,"Once you start watching The Game of Thrones. Started like and hating each character, your hook."
1,5.0,Started a lil slow but the series gets better and better after every episode.
1,4.5,"Game of Thrones is a beautifully shot, well-acted, and intricately written show that presents itself as the single best series on television."
1,5.0,"Fantasy will never be the same, with the arrival of this fantastic dark HBO TV Show. Based on the first novel, the TV Show closely follows George R.R. Martin's dark creation. The cinematography is brilliant, bringing an even bleaker approach to the genre, as is Ramin Djawadi's intricate score (the main title theme is astonishing). The level violence controls the entire film, while the film never shies away from grisly battles and graphic depictions, as well as sex and nudity. The casting is also terrific. Peter Dinklage steals almost every episode that he is in as the conniving and mysterious Tyrion Lannister, who at times is either a villain or good guy, though it is very difficult to tell. Sean Bean is perfectly cast as Ned Stark, while Lena Headey wonderfully depicts the wretched Cersei Lannister. The show is constantly surprising, primarily with the killing off of several major characters that viewers will fall in love with, but the show constantly moves along and works brilliantly. Job well done HBO."
1,4.0,"Game of Thrones' impressive production values are appreciative and serve well in the fantasy realm as a believably real world, but might at times cross the line in explicit gore and nudity/sex."
1,5.0,this is a test review2
1,5.0,The only TV show that's better than this is Breaking Bad.
1,5.0,The beginning to a memorable saga that will be remembered for decades.
1,4.0,Good enough to get me hooked. Working on Season 2 now...
1,5.0,Started of good and ended brilliantly.
1,5.0,"Game of Thrones gives us groundbreaking, intricate storytelling crowded by adult themes and political will. It is well acted, thematically satisfying with a dramatic style of writing."
1,5.0,"Today I am here to look at the greatest television show ever made: Game of Thrones. Based off the greatest book series of all time, A Song of Ice and Fire, it takes place in a dark fantasy world where royal houses contend for power in a bloody civil war. Nobody is favored and danger is everywhere; thing The Lord of the Rings meets The Godfather. We have excellent episode after excellent episode in the first season alone. We meet incredibly well-written characters, stunning sets, and threads of plots that lead into the ultimate goal: The Iron Throne of Westeros. It's basically flawless and probably the greatest piece of cinematic (more or less) art ever made. Even better than LotR, I mean it."
1,5.0,"Watching this again, not for the new season. The first season is still my favourite season, and Bean makes for the most interesting character in the series. Strong female characters and story arcs are laid here."
1,5.0,"Game of Thrones is a mouthful to take in and a definite investment, all well worth it I should add. Adapted from George R.R. Martins book series, Game of Thrones gives you the most realistic roster of characters you'll ever see. Forget traditional good guys vs. bad guys, Game of Thrones is merely this group who wants what they want vs. this group who wants what they want although there are plenty heroes and villains to be found throughout. Not to mention the story is not only very compelling but completely unpredictable and you'll never once have it pegged. Take time to invest in the show, it will be well worth it in the end."
2,4.5,"Damn why did I wait so long after the show to finally watch, omg this show is phucking awesome"
2,4.5,"Good second season with some more interesting developments to the world and plot. As second seasons typically do, it goes a bit slower than we'd like, but it's all for a good purpose of building up those character arcs. This is, I believe, the last season where people still thought it's a normal show more or less."
2,5.0,"Com cenários deslumbrantes e figurinos detalhados, cada episódio da série parecia uma obra-prima cinematográfica."
2,5.0,"Game of Thrones is a show of great significance to pop culture, having run from 2011 all the way to 2019. This show is one that has survived the test of time, grounding itself as one of the greatest shows of our era. However, in this 5-star review, I will not be mentioning season 8. Something happened in that season—something seemingly impossible and catastrophic. There was a grave issue within the production of that season that caused great pain for all Game of Thrones lovers, that season is not part of the rest of the show, it cannot, it was too painful and incorrect, changing every character as if the directors of the show did not even watch their own show. With that being said, the rest of the show is a pure masterpiece of cinema. Its beautifully crafted and well-written storyline, along with the nearly non-existent plot armour (almost), and the incredible visuals, make each episode akin to a full-blown blockbuster movie. All of this was achieved on a tighter schedule and with less money, which is a testament to the dedication and talent of the production team. I love this show and many others do too, it is truly one of the greatest shows ever produced."
2,5.0,Melhor série do mundo!
2,3.5,One of the Greatest shows of all time till the final few seasons then it fell apart
2,5.0,"This season is great, it manages to maintain the quality of the first one with a good cast and a great script"
2,4.5,"This season has been truly outstanding, undoubtedly ranking among the greatest series of all time. The show's intense and gripping storyline, filled with unexpected plot twists, captivates viewers from start to finish. Without a doubt, the Battle of Blackwater Bay scene stands out as an absolute masterpiece!"
2,4.0,What a great start to a show that was ruined by D&D...
2,4.0,Season 2 of GOT is even better than Season 1. It continues to expand the world and includes some very solid battle scenes. Definitely has me hooked for more!
2,4.5,Writing : 9/10 Acting : 10/10 Cinematography : 9/10 Costume design : 10/10 Set design : 10/10 CGI Effects 9/10 Artistic vision 10/10 Adaptation ranking : 10/10
2,5.0,this season was so good and absulutly so fresh to see cuz his season was so enjoyable from start to end especially the blackwater scene
2,5.0,"Another great season for game of thrones, Daenerys' storyline had a relatively slow start, but everything else is just the top of the top."
2,5.0,One of the best shows ever made.
2,4.5,A little slow in the beginning but worth the wait especially Battle if Blackwater!
2,5.0,This season expands on the lore and worldbuilding while developing a lot of characters.
2,1.0,Great story overshadowed by relentless chauvinism and tryhard shock value
2,4.0,"Season 2 builds on all the good aspects of season 1. With a more popular fan base behind the show, the production and budget increases are seen and enjoyed."
2,4.0,Yu just don't know who is going to be off-ed
2,5.0,Really great season one of my favourites.
2,4.5,"Game of Thrones follows up a strong debut with an even better second season, combining elegant storytelling and vivid characters to create a rich fantasy world."
2,5.0,"Just the best, tyrion coming to kings landing is so fun to watch."
2,5.0,"Captivating storytelling, astonishing production and marvelous character development allows GOT second season to soar even higher than the first season."
2,5.0,11/11 Going Strong... love GOT
2,5.0,"The first three seasons of GoT are by far the best. Medieval in setting and tone, gritty and creative and genuine—faithful adaptations of Martin's brilliant work."
2,5.0,"Season 2 is where things really kick off. The budget limitations of Season 1 are gone, so we can feast our eyes on the screen to enjoy a captivating story of immense magnitude. Great writing, acting, clever dialogue, beautiful cinematography. An absolute must see!"
2,5.0,Another brilliant and flawless season!
2,5.0,Awesome! Probably the best show ever.
2,4.5,The show hits hard. Seasons 2-6 are the best when it comes to the game of thrones. Season 7 is meh and then season 8 is.....well pretend that it got canceled.
2,5.0,Probably the best season of the series. Great plot and fantastic adaptaion.
2,4.5,A slower season without many stories or big moments. The character arcs esp. for Aryia have become amazing.
2,4.5,"The ramp up on every single aspect is felt throughout the season, with the core components being unbelievably as quality if not more so than the last season. It builds upon what was established, and expands on it in consistently satisfying and impressive ways. I thought originally that the loss from the previous season would be a hinderance to my capability to enjoy this season, and it in fact made me all the more invested. Bravo to the showrunners and to George R. R. Martin for that impressive feat."
2,5.0,"do do dododooodo do dodoo do do do doo! Few series quite as perfect as this one. Just one thing,,,,did winter ever really come?"
2,5.0,Absolutely brilliant loved it the mix of medieval theme and fantasy and white walkers horror it's brilliant and love it and the battle Sean's are amazing and brings the horror of battle to life like I've never seen before on a historical battlefields and dialogue all great
2,0.5,Pimples? Zero Action? Zero Any sort of interesting character or story? Zero!
2,5.0,Best season one !!! I like it characters
2,4.5,"While slightly less perfect than season one, because of a rocky start, this season redeems itself with an ideal second half."
2,5.0,esta segunda temporada se eleva aun mas con mas desarrollo de persona y narración solida
2,5.0,"""Elegant storytelling?"" sure but think of this as high-end pornography (hey, it's HBO) mixed with period costumes, dragons, queens, a dwarf and plenty of palace intrigue. For god's sake, please don't name your kid Khaleesi."
2,5.0,Amazing characters. One of the best tv shows.
2,4.5,My rating for the s2 is a 9.3/10
2,4.0,It's become Amazing and Amazing.
2,4.5,about the time where the show goes into high gear
2,5.0,"This show is a masterpiece. There is no doubt in my mind that it isn't. Despite the 8th season that most have agreed doesn't exist. This show remains my favorite of all time. This show changed what makes a show good, and proceeded to change it again, year after year. From the Starks in the North, The Martells in the South, The Lannisters in the West, and the Baratheon's in the East. This show is incredible. The politics and the ""Game of Thrones"" in the capitol, to the forshadowing of the white walkers at the wall, to the fight for the throne. This show is so dahm good. You see the events occur from almost every point of view, and it is all so entertaining. This is 100% one of the best shows of all time."
2,5.0,Essa segunda temporada continua com o mesmo modelo da primeira temporada. Uma ótima narrativa e ótimos personagens.
2,5.0,"Captivating storytelling, astonishing production and marvelous character development allows GOT second season to soar even higher than the first season."
2,0.5,"I have read the book and now I realized that the downfall started with season 2 (maybe season 1, but season 1 could be ok if it would be the final season). Season 2 Arya- Tywin was bad decision. In the book it was Arya -Bolton. Arya helped northerners (that were Bolton's to get the Herrin Hall and Bolton made Arya his servant as a sort of because he trusted her. Arya didn't say who she was and pretended that she is just a common girl. That made sense! Later she was disillusions in northerners and run away with Hot Pie and Gendry. She suffered through a huge identity crisis and that made sense for her to go to Bravos. Arya-Tywin episodes did not make sense at all! Everything with Arya and Jaqen H'ghar was much more constant in the book and made much better sense. Season 2 was the season when Deaneries story stopped make sense. In the book it all makes sense. She was fine with Dothraki in the abandoned city and she was invited to Quarth. She was getting quite a good sense of reality. She realized that there are only 3 dragons and thousands of ships and she wasn't tricked to exchange dragon to a ship. She rejected the marriage proposal and split. The story with her dragons stolen in the show didn't make sense at all. It didn't happen like that in the book. Well Tyrion was still good. Stannis was Ok, although some details in the book made it more consistent. Battle of Blackwater was good. But all the build up for Sansa stories, her conversations with Sir Dantos and Clegeign were lost. And they were important for understanding what is going on in future. Oh. Robb and Talisia story was a garbage! Look a young attractive girl travelling along at the war and do what? She is a healer. LOL Nobody cared about healers. It is the society that didn't care about cripples. And she is performing amputations. Double LOL. It is not American civil war, it is a medieval war where it is better to die than be a cripple, especially if you are not a high lord! So we have Brianna that is a huge ugly girl with a sword and still she is risking to get raped, so what about Talisia? By the time Robb would meet her she already would be forced into prostitution. Nobody knows that she is some sort of noble woman from Volantes that they don't care, she is just a common girl for them. Her protection could be a noble title with a good amount of guards or a church protection. Then she should be a nun in a church and still would have guards to protect nuns from crazy and evil people on the road. She is not a nun and looks like she is travelling along. So how did she get so far? It all doesn't make sense and they just should stick with the book version that was logical and realistic. But it was watchable, and it wasn't the worst, those that come after were worse."
2,4.0,"Not as good as season 1, but it's still very good. The production value is higher and most of the new characters feel right at home, but the writing g doesn't carry the same weight."
2,5.0,esta serie se pone buena con esta temporada con una narracion mas estructurada
2,4.5,"As great as season 1! The well-written story and dialogues continues, the relations between the highly diverse characters are set perfect in scene!"
2,5.0,"Novamente, a excelência de GoT se mostra viva."
2,4.0,"Great show, i understand the appeal, very adictive, some scenes lack sense, there are gaps in the script but the story is hypnotizing enough to forget those details"
2,5.0,"Incredible show, at least till it follows the books. After it surpasses the books, problems start. Last season is best not mentioned."
2,4.0,"Pretty spectacular follow up to season 1, characters are fleshed out and you are always a bit off balance because you know they will kill anyone off at any time. Superb"
2,5.0,This season capitalized on all the potential the first season had. The narrative of the series truly gets moving in this season and everything finally feels like it's going somewhere. Excellent.
2,4.0,Absolutely great. The story with Daeneryes isn't all that interesting this season but everything happening in Westeros is very interesting. The final episodes of the season are some of the best in the show.
2,5.0,"With the Starks all split up after the events of Season 1, you now get to start to see their development and growth as characters while they struggle and persevere. With the Lanasters growing in their strength you also get to see how they evolve and grow as characters when in positions of power, with the tension rising in Westeros and now that the War Of The Five Kings has begun both sides find themselves making new enemies and foes."
2,4.0,The second season closely follows the second book with some changes here and there. Great adaptation with memorable characters. You can really tell the budget's getting bigger.
2,0.5,Season 2 continued to set us up to fail for the series failure in season 8.
2,5.0,"The second season is as good, if not better, than season 1. Just don't get fond of the character, because the keep dying. I loved this season.."
2,5.0,Yeah I love this man
2,5.0,"Com um primeiro ano bem-sucedido, Game of Thrones trazia um livro mais denso para adaptar, e uma trama mais agitada com a Guerra dos Cinco Reis. É uma temporada mais sofisticada e bem produzida, incluindo também a primeira grande batalha com Água Negra, e que coloca a série em um caminho empolgante. E a quarta melhor temporada de Game of Thrones!"
2,4.5,"The story continues seamlessly, it is also more ambitious with its use of a huge cast and many significant locations. While this is very well done and commendable, it is hurt a little by the fact that there isn't a clear main storyline that grounds the others, everywhere is important. The main characters are very well handled and developed throughout the season but while there are many great scenes none truly compare to last seasons most significant moments. Still, this is very much in the setup phase of the story and the fact that they adapted it so well deserves great praise."
2,3.5,nearly as good as season 1. the ending is easily the best part of this season
2,5.0,Well done great action
2,5.0,"Game of Thrones is back, and its bigger and better than ever."
2,5.0,"The first season of Game of Thrones was phenomenal, and the second one is not lagging behind. Acting, as usual, is phenomenal, profound of the world is unprecedentedly good, everything that the first season had has this, but what this season is even better at than the first is the script and the plot. The script is incredibly high-quality, no episode is lacking, the plot flow is constantly good and no episode is airticked and hasty or too slow and stretched, the plot progresses forward a little bit, and the whole season escalates in the penultimate episode of ""Blackwater"" which is the best we've had a chance to see in the first two seasons. Among the other episodes, I would point out ""Valar Morghulis"", which has one of the most shocking scenes in the whole series, and I would point out ""The Old Gods and the New"" which also has some pretty intriguing moments. This season shows up for the first time some of the show's main characters such as Davos Seaworth and Stannis Baratheon. This season still manages to be not a level quality of the first season, so I'd say it's even better, must watch."
2,3.5,better ... but not yet convinced me
2,4.5,"Very good second season, a little bit better than the first season."
2,4.5,"Even better than the first season, but just shy of getting a 5/5 star rating."
2,5.0,"This season we noticed a great advance compared to the first, it is much better in all aspects, especially the battle of Blackwater !!!"
2,4.5,"Game of Thrones S2 continues the outstanding narrative and it's still very loyal to its source material. I still prefer S1, but this is great as well."
2,3.0,"The cast tries its best to carry the show, but the writing is already becoming weak whereever it needs to deviate from the source material."
2,4.5,"after established the ambient in first season, here we saw a amazing cast, great battles and a screen play well developed with some episodes that we are never forget."
2,2.5,There are some great moments in this season but are otherwise surrounded by boring bottom of the barrel wizard trash.
2,4.5,Just as great as the first season
2,5.0,Even better than the first season.
2,5.0,Who's going to die next? I don't even know
2,4.5,Game of Thrones Season 2 | Detailed note: 9.2
2,0.5,Most overrated show of all time I was waiting for some character or even just some welly filmed action but never got either in all of these seasons
2,3.5,"an improvement from its predecessor for sure, but this time it feels a little slower which may or may not be good."
2,5.0,continues to be fucking amazing
2,5.0,Desde el primer capítulo hasta el final de temporada te mantiene al filo del asiento.
2,5.0,"Even if u hated the ending this is by far the greatest show of all time. Each episode keeps u on the edge of your seat. Never have i ever heard as many people talk about whats gunna happen next week. There was just a lot of people upset because they didn't get what they want but that is what the whole show was, you never got what u wanat"
2,5.0,"An embarrassment of riches. I may have preferred the first season over the second, but only by a hair. Near flawless storytelling, writing, acting, cinematography, set design ...everything on every level for a sophomore entry in television period. 9.6/10"
2,5.0,How can a show be that much affective!ep9 and ep10 was amazing speechless as hell!literally the moment of time at ep9 ending i was literaly blown away!music is damn great!best season for sure!
2,5.0,"The scenes between Arya and Tywin, really amazing. I love this season with all my heart. It had a gripping story that was full of intrigue and added, expanded, more of my favorite characters in the whole show. The ending to this season was also spectacular and very well done. The writing gets even better. There's honestly not much that I can say besides it being an extremely well done tv show."
2,4.5,"Not as Good AS the First one, but still entertaining. Great characters, Production, Design. One Epic battle"
2,5.0,"best, it was really good, i enjoyed it. please give us no2 etc asap. as I WANT MORE !!!!"
2,4.0,Rating: 8/10. 80/100
2,5.0,"Another great season, it did not disappoint"
2,4.0,great season and character development
2,4.0,A slow start pays off in spectacular fashion in the penultimate episode.
2,5.0,The second season is even better. Tight Writing from George R. R. Martin and consequences for every character choice is what makes the series a gripping watch.
2,5.0,"Enthralling, still captures the essence of the first seasons while presenting new stakes and characters. Not disappointed, hungry for more!"
2,4.5,"Overall better and more consistent than the first season. The season finale of the first is more hype, but this one still finishes out strong. The exploitation is still there but not as gross in this season."
2,5.0,As close to perfect as it gets.
2,0.5,way to much talking make a show for people to actually watch
2,4.5,"Game of Thrones cements itself as a drama with real consequences. Death is like breathing on this show, and I absolutely love it. (A-)"
2,4.5,Very fun to watch because of storys and character arcs.
2,0.5,"The story of game of thrones is fake, wrong and family destroying. full of sad scenes like rape, killing innocent people, adult parts. all the people slept together.!!! Too bad"
2,4.5,One of the better seasons - medieval drama with strong characters!
2,5.0,"Season 2 continues to add depth and richness to the characters and world established in season 1, while the various plot-lines are compelling. There is little to complain about, from the acting to the cinematography, to Ramin Djawadi's brilliant soundtrack."
2,3.5,"Good. Awesome battle scenes, somewhat slow plot but it gets there."
2,4.5,"Building on everything that made the first season so good and with the endingof the first season, season two is a gateway for multiple fantastic character storylines. As always the plot and the story are getting stronger and the fantasy world is starting to develop into something interesting."
2,4.5,una serie enorme que no deberes encariñarte con ningún personajes
2,5.0,"Really great actors, writing and well done special effects."
2,5.0,"Unneccessary deviations from the book, which sucks for people like me who respect the original work of the author. If the book does nothing wrong and can be adapted easily into TV then there's no need to make weird changes to the story. Otherwise another fantastic season of this brilliant show."
2,5.0,"Season 2 of Game of Thrones does a great job expanding on the world that was introduced in season 1. So much of this season adds to the worldbuilding, especially learning the variations of religion though-out Westeros. (Sadly, what happens in season 8 makes this season not as good once you know how pointless a lot of it is.)"
2,5.0,"Even though I didn't care for this book in the series as much, it's one of the best seasons."
2,4.5,"The cracks are starting to show, but wow the Battle of Blackwater Bay delivers in so many ways."
2,4.5,This show took everything that made the first season great and made it even better in this season.
2,4.5,"Just another continuation of all of the best character Arcs, and some amazing action. A few of the many great moments in this season would be the Battle of Blackwater, Tyrion's journey, and Tywin's conversation with Arya."
2,5.0,"This season was a fantastic continuation from the first and gave us even more action, more characters and more Peter Dinklage. Also, hands down one of the best season finales ever - that end scene from beginning to end gave me chills."
2,5.0,"Season 2 of game of thrones doubles down on everything, more action, more villains, more locations, more mystery and more characters! It is the perfect second season anyone could ask for! The battle of black water is just perfection!"
2,4.5,"Great story telling, great writing, great production, great acting ... This is where GoT begins its launch into epic show territory."
2,5.0,ABSOLUTELY AMAZING!!!! I loved every episode!!! Awesome storyline!!!
2,5.0,Amazing! the best show of the world!
2,5.0,Season 2 did not disappoint in any means.
2,5.0,the politics and action are raised in this amazing adaptation of a clash of kings
2,5.0,"Game of Thrones returns in full force with a thrilling second season that is mindbending, brutal, and ominous."
2,5.0,"This an amazing season and it has some of the best twists and not to mention the Battle of Black Water Bay which was great. This set up for the 3rd season perfectly just like the 1st season for the 2nd. We get a lot of character development with Arya, Daenerys, Robb, Theon, Jaime, and the rest of the Lannisters."
2,2.5,The cracks in the writing begin to show with this season.
2,0.5,Don't waste your time. Ending destroys the whole thing. Creators failed HUGE
2,5.0,"Game of Thrones is still my 2nd favorite show and I loved this season even more than the first. The lead ensemble cast were outstanding especially Peter Dinklage, Lena Headey, Emilia Clarke, Maisie Williams, Richard Madden, Kit Harington, Charles Dance, Sophie Turner, Alfie Allen, Isaac Hempstead Wright, Michelle Fairley, John Bradley, and Sibel Kekilli. Gwendoline Christie, Stephen Dillane, Carice van Houton, Natalia Tena, Nikolaj Coster-Waldau, Rose Leslie, Gemma Whelan, Conleth Hill, Aidan Gillen, and Iain Glen also gave fantastic performances. The writing and storytelling are even more remarkable this season. The visual effects were more excellent this season especially the wildfire explosion, the baby dragons, and the shadow demon that killed Renly Baratheon. The makeup is still great especially all of the stab and cut wounds. The outfits and costumes were terrific especially the blue and gold dress the Emilia Clarke wore as Daenerys and the lavender dress that Sophie Turner wore as Sansa. The fighting and battle scenes were very well executed and choreographed. All of the sets and scenery are just remarkable. The music and score were great just like last season especially the song The Rains of Castamere featured in the end credits of episode nine. Also the White Walkers in the last scene of the season was so cool and creepy, I loved it. Definitely another A+ season."
2,4.5,"Another great season with the story really staring to ramp up, as always terrific acting and production. ""Blackwater"" is absolutely stunning visually."
2,3.5,Season 2 has many good moments but completely lost my interest a few times
2,4.5,Great 2nd season! Better than the 1st season with more characters and farewell to others that I was stunned to see go... Game of Thrones characters are fro everyone! Some you cheer for others you hate but still can't stop watching. A great show!
2,5.0,Better than the first season
2,4.0,Season 2 will not disappoint!
2,5.0,"Tyrion Lannister really shines in this season. The direction, action, acting everything was perfect. The last few episodes were epic. Yet another great season from the greatest TV show ever."
2,4.0,Not as good as season one.
2,5.0,"Finally a show without those stupid Hollywoodish, PG-13 happy endings. Something serious."
2,5.0,running strong. the pace kicks into second gear. raising the bet. introducing more characters.
2,4.5,Season 2 introduces new characters and brings the high-budget action in TV.
2,5.0,Best show on TV. top 3 best show of all time
2,4.5,"It may have started slower in comparison to its predecessor, but not even that was enough to thwart Game of Thrones from delivering a spectacle-filled, violent and gripping second season."
2,5.0,The books where amazing and the show is extremely engaging!
2,5.0,"As we get to know all characters in an overcrowded medieval soap opera, Game of Thrones thrives at humanizing every single one of them but yet show the despicable nature of human beings."
2,5.0,"Game of Thrones season 2 gives another phenomenal season even better than it's strong debut season. It gives more brilliant storytelling, acting, direction and writing, and introduces us to some more great characters. While sadly this is a show where main characters are killed off, it always remains great. Game of Thrones season 2 continues to bring us into a rich fantasy world with the seven kingdoms and every other brilliant thing in it."
2,1.0,Adaption: Grade D Faithful of Source: No (Due not having 20 Episodes for Novel 1) Faithful of Characters: No (Due not having 20 Episodes for Novel 1)
2,5.0,Game of thrones second season expands the world of its first season leading to a more intricate and more compelling story.
2,5.0,"Story, Cast, Acting, VFX etc every is Tremendous also Most Realistically Written Series, Realism means nothing blurred or muted or cut e.g. Sex Scenes & violence Scenes which makes it different from other TV series & Amazing & Realistic... Also High Fantasy, Kings, Queen, Wars, White Walker (Snow Monsters) & Dragons Makes it Great High fantasy TV Series... To the point & Close to the Book, This TV series is Magnificent & Excellent, I Really Liked it Rated 10/10 Regards"
2,4.5,"Now with the -not very- step forward season, season two... As I said, it's not a very step forward, but it's defiantly better than the first one! It had a slow storytelling, but not like the first season, and the saviors this time, saved it very well! The CGI of episode 9 was brilliant... BTW, this episode was the best in this season. So the performance is definitely better than the first one, and the story got richer, actually! So GoT season two is better and more effective than season one!"
2,5.0,even better than the first
2,5.0,The best TV series of all time.
2,1.0,"Please, more of the same - soap-opera fantasy. Think Downton Abbey, only with more beheadings and sibling-humping."
2,4.5,"The true nature of characters are out this season. One of important, well directed and well acted seasons of all time."
2,4.5,This season is pretty good because the cast has shifted and the stories have been thrown everywhere. This is great because it makes the show less predictable and interesting with new characters and creatures.
2,5.0,"The second season of Game Of Thrones is perfect, just like the first season. That's all that needs to be said in my book."
2,4.0,Puntaje Original: 8.5 Ligeramente mejor que la temporada pasada; pero cabe señalar que Peter Dinklage nos trae uno de los mejores personajes vistos en pantalla chica.
2,5.0,"This season dragged on a bit but it was fantastic to watch. Joffrey was the best villian I had ever seen, yet."
2,4.0,"Game of Thrones adopts a slower pace this season fueled mostly by worldbuilding, exposition, and political intrigue, without losing any of its singular charm."
2,2.5,"Seasons 2-4 of GoT have similar deffects: an elongated plot (it was thought for 3 books, now it has seven), interesting characters which disappear while the just ambitious and pragmatic survive, too insistence on chaos and inesperate deaths (there is a certain moment a meteor could fall and you will think is as realistic and also as out of narrative as the rest of the story)."
2,4.5,"Muy buena continuación de la temporada 1, los personajes avanzan, la historia se vuelve más intensa y los conflictos cada vez afectan más a la audiencia. Grandes efectos para una serie de TV."
2,4.5,TV doesnt get much better
2,4.0,IT's going very well
2,4.0,Game of Thrones: Season 2 Game of Thrones season 2 did two amazing job : maintain the filmmaking quality and expand the series universe
2,4.5,"The great debut season is followed up with an even bigger second season. The storytelling and acting are again great, while the characters are fleshed out even more. Unpredictable and captivating."
2,4.5,Far better than season 1 combining great acting and storytelling with fantastic fantasy elements that make it must see.
2,5.0,Not quite 5/5 but of course still brilliant.
2,4.5,"Season two of one of the greatest shows ever made will thrill most of its fans even more than the first, but some segments may disappoint fans of the book series. Some epic scenes a bit underplayed; plus some book characters are cut out of the show all together while a couple of others are changed completely for the show's benefits. It may take a couple of episodes in order to get back in to the show, because the first episode immediately hits the ground running without giving us a prologue, like season one, that helps reintroduce us into this world, gradually."
2,5.0,"If I ought to be a king someday, I'd demand for Joffrey Baratheon's head... and his costumes."
2,5.0,"It's safe to say there's never been a television series like Game of Thrones. Television fantasy tends to fall into one of two camps - cheap, campy and surprisingly enduring or frugal, serious and short-lived. Either way, fantasy shows also tend to fall, be it by way of dwindling creative returns, waning interest or network ax. Game of Thrones, though, is one of those rare genre series to aim high, strike with deadly precision and leave viewers begging for more, even at a scant 10 episodes per season. The mythology is dense and the characters numerous, the storylines complex and the conflict more so. It's high fantasy done right, from its spellbinding source - author George R.R. Martin's ""A Song of Ice and Fire"" book series - to its casting, production design, scripting, storytelling, ever-shifting game board of power players and opportunists, gripping politics, blistering drama, vile villains, flawed everymen and shocking developments. Hardly an episode passes without something of consequence altering the rules of the game, and life and death are far from certain. Martin and executive producers, head writers David Benioff and D.B. Weiss are willing to sacrifice any character if the story demands it, and have done so despite the occasional outcry of devastated fans. Season two is no stranger to such sacrifice, and advances with authority, meticulous strategy and a merciless end to every means. It isn't a perfect run - season one was more consistent and consistently momentous, and season two makes several relatively small but rather unnecessary departures from Martin's ""A Clash of Kings"" - but as sophomore seasons go, Game of Thrones charges ahead with confidence and conviction, and it's the series' growing fanbase that reaps the reward."
2,5.0,the best thing ive ever seen.... ^_^
2,5.0,"It just keeps getting better, it's even more intense, it's full of characters and it just grabs your attention."
2,4.5,Tu no sabes nada Juan Nieves
2,4.0,Puntaje Original: 8.5 Ligeramente mejor que la temporada pasada; pero cabe señalar que Peter Dinklage nos trae uno de los mejores personajes vistos en pantalla chica.
2,5.0,Season 2 is just as amazing as the first season.
2,5.0,"Game of Thrones... Do I have to say anything more? Just watch it! The smartest show still on the air, and the best world-building in all of television; a triumph!"
2,0.5,Second most boring TV season of any show created.
2,5.0,"Great season, truly amazing"
2,5.0,"Great sequel. As usual, every ending of an episode makes you thirst for more."
2,5.0,"The show only gets better and better, the characters a better developed, and the story and writing continues to surprise me."
2,5.0,"As we delve deeper into this ""game of thrones"" slowly unfolding in front of us, the story only gets more intricate and addicting, the characters more cunning and engaging, and the visual directorial execution even more beautifully crafted to perfection. I'll say it again, with this season finding ways to get even better than the first, that ""Game of Thrones"" is perhaps the greatest and most ambitious TV drama series to ever be produced."
2,4.0,"It's been so long I can barely remember what happened in this season. It almost felt like the season in between everything all of the important parts of the season. I know that there was the Battle of the Blackwater but that is just about all I can remember. But lets face it. There is a guarantee of good content, quality acting, great music and amazing visuals. So although the action may not be too memorable to me 4 years later I will tell you to watch it anyway. All I know is that it is Game of Thrones and I kept watching afterwards."
2,5.0,"Game of Thrones is back and it's incredible yet again. The characters are so strong that they could hold the movie up if it had a bad story, but id doesn't. The story is good, the visuals are good, and the acting is incredible. This is epic fantasy of the highest order."
2,3.5,"I Think i've lost myself on some of the slower paced elements, yet Game of Thrones follows up some good nice set ups, and in battle secuences it's undeniably well crafted, so, it works."
2,5.0,one of the greatest tv series of all time
2,5.0,"Season 2 offers more of the powerful emotion, fantastical wonder, and white knuckle thrills to this bloodbath of drama and fantasy"
2,4.5,"overall great second season, nothing big to complain, but differences between books and show are growing..."
2,4.0,"Game of Thrones: season 2 is the proof that what happens in such a little time in this story, can perfectly combine with its bloody and thrilling action, whose the last 2 episodes will be decisive to make this season a dazzling adaptation to theme."
2,4.0,"Game of Thrones: season 2 is the proof that what happens in such a little time in this story, can perfectly combine with its bloody and thrilling action, whose the last 2 episodes will be decisive to make this season a dazzling adaptation to theme."
2,4.5,"Proof that a series can live on even after some of the headline characters disappear, Game of Thrones second season is filled with drama, action, and some shocking surprises. There continues to be some great acting; I feel the performances here are more nuanced and interesting, given the actor involved have had a chance to really zone in on what makes their character tick. The tone of the season has also shifted, its become less good versus bad and more everyone has their problems."
2,5.0,"Meet Stannis, the Wildlings, Qarth and witness the War of the Five kings! Such an epic (the battle of Blackwater is one of the most amazingly crafted battles i've seen in movie/TV history)."
2,5.0,"Not for a long time has television seen a show of such allure. Game of Thrones has taken me as well as thousands of other viewers by our ears and eyes into a new world, one that we become emotionally attached to. When starting such a series, one must be skeptical, but no fear, this is a ride you want to stay on. Perfectly cast, and entertaining and informational to even the people who have not read the novels, the creators of the show have hit this one out of the ballpark. I personally have become engrossed and am always craving more of my favorite house's adventures in Westeros. Thank you, HBO, for taking me to a new place for an hour at a time."
2,5.0,Game of Thrones follows up a strong debut with an even better second season.
2,5.0,"Starting off at a slower pace than its predecessing season, a lot of the fan favorites still had some great atory arcs to be shown. From Tyrion as the Hand of the King as well as Arya's residence in Harrenhal, to Daenerys' betrayal at Qarth, this seasoin provided a lot of great entertaiment, Few will also forget neither a violent riot at King's Landing nor THAT wildfire explosion."
2,5.0,A far more better season than season one. Entertaining from start to finish.
2,5.0,"With the stakes risen, the cast grows and the intensity is strong- Game of Thrones Season 2 is phenomenal."
2,1.0,I watched all season one and I thought it was pretty solid. Watched the first two episodes and half of the third episode of season two.. I think its really slow and not good at all so far... Spartacus and Vikings is way better..
2,3.5,Someone has to stay alive to care about!
2,2.5,"Admittedly, my opinion on this season contradicts the major vote and I find myself disliking the show after it, unlike most people. With just as much potential as the first season, George RR Martin had to write the perfect story to keep the fans watching. In my opinion he has failed in his endeavour and created something very different from what I had hoped for. Incredible characters portrayed by unbelievably good actors are important, but without good writing they are not enough. They take on a challenge, trying to make the stories into something worth watching, yet they fail. Not to say the season is terrible, but it is a bit boring. You can see the writer has a bunch of more seasons in mind, taking a good short story, fitting perhaps for just a few episodes, and stretching it far too wide. Politics take precedence over drama, and the action part is the smallest one although we expect it to be an action drama. While the concept of political games is right there in the title, I expected a more interesting background story to support the Intrigue. Letting the dragons age slowly was a mistake in my opinion, as the anticipation grew, with little to none realization for it. Same goes towards the white walkers and wights. We were expecting them for quite some time, since the first episode of season one, and again there was hardly any mention of them. To me, it was a big mistake to minimize and delay they're appearance on screen, as it was one of most curious and fascinating subjects I expected to see in the series, and especially in season two. All in all, the story is far too long, with far too little action to make it interesting, and as excellent as the actors are, even they couldn't save this season from the bowels of mediocrity. This season is only worthy of the grade C, which was more than enough reason for me to stop watching."
2,3.0,"A continuation of nothing. My impressions of the first season were mixed and it really was overrated. This second is no exception. The first five episodes are pretty much the same; we get even more character introductions and a well written story. The story got much build-ups, our characters keeps planning and discussing events. Thats both a problem and a unique aspect of Game of Thrones. Its a great thing because we can at a greater scale understand why certain events come to pass, and why our characters behave as they do. We also get closer to them and when the show really do pay off; we begin to love the show. I totally agree on that matter, but all the slow and less entertaining dialogs and build-ups are so boring. I admire that GoT really is something unique, but therere no action-sequences! The first half is as I mentioned very much alike as the first season; nothing really big does happen, but it got its character developments (and introductions). The lack of action is very outspread. I was a bit disappointed, because there were some signs of great action here and there, we see men preparing for battle, but at some point in the first half of the season they skip showing that, and continue after the battle; so annoying and depressing! The whole season is very similar with the first; much build-ups and boring dialogs, but there are some unexpected events and the characters are the one strong aspect with the show! The season finale is much better than in the first season; its intense, bloody, realistic and much unique amount of action exists (finally!). Another aspect is the actors; yes they are all stunning, but Richard Madden is hard to take serious as an actor (doesnt fit the role). This second continuation of the overrated show Game of Thrones is both much more action-packed, but even more slow than its predecessor. The slow but still interesting story still defines the show but nothing big really happens. Too much preparing storylines makes the show slow and boring. But the characters and the big and great final episodes made it a bit greater than the first season. Relatable characters, unique (but low amount of) action, awesome title sequence and a powerful storytelling is still the only aspects thats great. But I did expect much more, because we had one whole season of nothing, and here it is, another season of more nothing! My overall rating for each episode is 6.48/10. 6/10"
2,4.5,Solid continuation of the series.
2,3.5,"7.0/10 — ""Pretty Good/Engaging"" -(Seen in JAN '21)"
2,5.0,Season 2 brings more thrill and excitement to the show with new characters and bold directions. The battle of the Blackwater bay was the best thing I've seen.
2,4.5,"Gives us more of everything we wanted, at a faster pace as well. Daenarys story arc this time around was fairly weak however."
2,5.0,"Game of Thrones' second season proves even better than the first, and will please viewers who enjoyed the series debut."
2,5.0,Personal favourite of the series.
2,5.0,Not as good as the first season but still proves the show is up there with the television greats.
2,4.0,Season 2 pulled and delighted me.
2,5.0,"Absolutely fantastic. You have to watch it to believe it, but this is one of the best shows on TV and really does justice to the epic scale of George Martin's novels."
2,3.5,"I thought GoT was going to press forward and never look back, but instead, it looks like they needed season 2 to set things up for what's to come. So a great deal of the second season was used to set the stage rather than show copious amounts of action. For this, the lower rating; but I still have very high hopes for the seasons ahead."
2,5.0,"Adding amazing characters to it's already rich roster, Game of Thrones continues to be the show it promises to be."
2,4.0,"In its second season, Game of Thrones is still delivering some of the best moments on television in years, though its not as tightly knit as Season 1."
2,4.5,"Game of Thrones's second season continues to shine by delivering top notch writing and entertainment, leaving spectators hungry for more."
2,4.0,Expands the world Season 1 gave us in bigger and better ways.
2,4.0,"The second season is not quite as good as the first. That being said, it's dark, thrilling and intriguing all at once, and delivers well-developed characters, stunning visuals and a glorious fantasy world."
2,4.0,the thrill of winter continues!
2,4.5,Holy GUACAMOLEE! I just love this.
2,4.5,"Game of Thrones Season 2 continues to build up its massive storytelling and visual enthrallment. From strong performances to even stronger dramatic plots, this season exceeds any expectation and easily provides more acclaim from its audiences and growing fanbase/followers. 4.5/5"
2,5.0,"With the momentum left behind by the end of last season and Peter Dinklage getting an expanded roll, there is more tense political drama, murder, and mayhem in this adaption of Clash of Kings."
2,4.5,"More drama than ever. Favorite Episodes: 9, 10."
2,4.5,"The second season increases the size of the story, characters and scope, delivering a superior second season with more to love than ever. Epic battles, smart dialogue and an unbeatable sense of tension and complexity, Game of Throne's second season makes the show bigger and better in all positive ways."
2,4.5,"Picks up tremendously in both intrigue and in pace from the first season which seems to punish you unforgivingly if you fail to remember every name and every detail off the cuff. But once you've tightened a hard enough grip, season 2 offers more rewards than you could have imagined, rendering you hopelessly addicted and leaving you in a state of severe withdrawal until the next season."
2,4.5,"Well written and anchored by Peter Dinklage's banner year, Season 2 proves once again that Game of Thrones is one of the best shows around."
2,4.5,"The second season gets even bigger, better, and stronger as they introduced new elements into the series. The well written script will leaves you craving for more."
2,5.0,"Season 2 continues to build the excitement of the mythos as again supplementing Martin's corresponding book. So many moments jeered at me and screamed, ""Look away, I dare you. But you will regret it if you do."""
2,4.0,Keeps getting better.
2,4.5,"Even better than Season 1. Is absolutely addicting, well acted, well written and all around just amazing."
2,5.0,excellent series written well and unbelievably great to watch. Love this series all the way .
2,5.0,"As demonstrated with the beheading of Ned Stark, Game of Thrones will do unexpected and brutal things such as kill their protagonist in the first season. The second season continues in that vein with more of the unexpected and brutal, culminating in easily the best battle sequence ever put to the small screen. Season 2 is another great installment for Game of Thrones and will leave viewers excited for the next season, all while keeping true to George R. R. Martin's excellent books."
2,4.5,"Picking up right where the first season left off, season two picks up both the pace and the intensity as the show hits its stride. In what is the best season thus far, the scale gets far more epic and the characters more developed. Everything about this season is an improvement to the first one, except for the lack of confidence in themselves... In the first season, they were willing to kill anyone and everyone, and in this season, they shy away from that. Perhaps this is because of the books (since the show follows them relatively well), but whatever the reason, that is a weakness."
2,5.0,"Is it possible to top a great 1st season? not at all. for instance house of cards lost all its glamour in 2nd season. Viewers already know the characters so it is required to feed them with a great story, nice twists & excellent acting. GOT Season 2 is one of the best seasons ever. ""Blackwater"" goes into my list of best season finale & ""King in the north"" makes it to the list of best opening episode. Peter Dinklage & Lena Heady are the standout performers"
2,5.0,The second season gets even more epic.
2,3.0,"New characters were great, but the show suffers (slightly) by essentially being a setup for later and better seasons."
2,4.0,"The chessboard that is The Westeros has been laid flat and the pieces slowly put into place, for Season 2 of HBO's Game of Thrones is all about the measured tactics (and internal turmoil) of imminent warfare. New characters are introduced, others taken out and more hinted at as any continuation of a series usually does. The more Game of Thrones opens up and the nuts and bolts are seen grinding away that makes up this wonderful world, the more the viewer will learn to love (and loath) what is seen. This is undoubtedly due to the rich source material, which still has surprises in large supply with characters from Season 1 being shown in a new light. The strong writing is further reinforced by exceptional acting from the ever-welcome (and ever-fluctuating) cast, highlighted by Peter Dinklage (continuing his remarkable performance as Tyrion Lannister). But Season 2 is not without its faults, as it does have a shade of ""Second Season Syndrome"" (a curse that many great shows have fallen into). The writing is still sharp and clever as ever; the production value still efficiently grand and the directing in each of the 10 episodes exceptional, but sections of the plot feel spread thin, where other sections have too much. This unevenness aside, one senses that all of that is a known sacrifice for the setup for Season 3, which promises even more pieces to be played on the chessboard."
2,5.0,"Vivid, elegant, dark and consistently gripping, Game of Thrones' thrilling second season provides all the ingredients needed for an engrossing television drama."
2,5.0,"Every season of Game of Thrones just takes everything to a whole new level. There's more drama, an even more intriguing story, better performances, more shocked and as always brilliant writing. It's a show that keeps on delivering."
2,5.0,This is a show that keeps on getting better with each episodes. There's more magic elements which is what I want to see and characters are fully realized. I wish they could show more of the dragons but the budgets isn't the same as movie budgets.
2,4.5,"With the strong debut of season one, Game of Thrones follows up with giving us a powerhouse opening and never failing to let from with each episode. Taking us to some great locations, and new characters adding to mix each giving fantastic performances. This is a rich fantasy world that is created with care."
2,4.5,"92% I have actually started to like Game of Thrones more than what I wanted to. I liked the first season, but I would have to say that it's ending sucked and it was more disappointing that the finale of Dexter season 8. But second season strikes back with mind blowing action and spectacular visual effects. The second last episode was the best of season 2. Although the crisp dialogues have gone since the first season finished and the plot twists are not as unpredictable, this season just doesn't disappoint. The first 4 episodes were full of twists and the new characters in this season are good as well. Then the few intermediate episodes disappoint, but this season strikes gold with the last 2 episodes. The only sore thumb in this season is the story of Daenerys Targaryen, the actors in that segment do justice to their roles, but they don't have much to do since the story is poorly developed. Actually the plot elements in Qarth felt unnecessary. Closing the 1st season with the story of Khalesar was a mistake, but this time they rectify it by showing you the part of the Night watch in The Wall."
2,5.0,I thought I saw the best from television with the first season. I was wrong.
2,5.0,This season sets up season 3 but we know that already.
2,4.5,"Continues the excellent writting, acting and action set pieces that the first Season introduced, with even more intricate betrayls and characters that might change the game at every turn. It's ruthless, violent, exciting and I wouldn't have it any other way."
2,5.0,Season Two continues the brilliant storytelling of the first season except with an even bigger sense of scale and larger budget. Episode 9 in particular features one of the greatest action sequences ever committed to television. Both returning and new characters are all performed flawlessly by a great cast and the increased fantasy elements don't take from the stories continued commentary on the manipulations of political power. It continues to prove itself one of the best shows ever made for television
2,5.0,No words... Simply awesome... its getting better and better in each and every Episode. And am in Love with Danereyus Targereyan :)
2,4.0,"There are fewer twists in this season, but it's faster in pace and still enthralling."
2,5.0,better than the 1st season
2,4.5,Even stronger second seasonbut wait till next year!
2,4.5,Peter Dinklage leads a stellar cast in what is a solid improvement over the first season.
2,5.0,completely fallen in love with Emilia Clarke.... Peter dinklage and kit harington are my other two favourite characters in the program... completely spellbounded by the makers of this program...
2,4.5,An amazing second season to follow up the groundbreaking first.
2,5.0,This is my idea of a near perfect TV season. There is never a dull moment as the action heats up from where season 1 left off. Absolutely fantastic.
2,4.5,"I wish more books would be adapted like this. It really is amazing to see what a cast and crew can do with so much extra screen time. Not to say that movies based on books are bad, but for a series of this kind, it's great to see that it's receiving the treatment it deserves. Season 2 picks up directly where Season 1 left off, with Ned Stark dead and several different men making claims to the throne. The Starks are separated, Daenerys has her dragons, and the Lannisters are (surprise, surprise) up to no good. With so many engrossing story lines, it's hard to pick out the stand outs from the season - each character feels fleshed out, authentic, real. I would have to say Arya's story was the standout for me - it was just consistently great, even when very little was happening. Also, Peter Dinklage's portrayal of Tyrion Lannister continued to be one of the shining points of the season - no thanks to the excellent combination that is his acting and the script. Speaking of the script, I think that stands as one of the best parts of the show; while plot points can be tough to follow sometimes, the banter between characters never fails to entertain. It's intelligent, often times hilarious, and never dumb - fantasy can be pretty cheesy sometimes, but not Game of Thrones. The show goes full steam ahead. Lastly, I'd like to note that the production and costume design on this show put so many movies to shame. The show is beautiful to look at, and the effects look awesome. Jon Snow's adventures beyond the wall offered some of the best locales of the season, and I loved that we got to see more of the kingdoms this season. Effects used in the show's many battles were consistently brutal, bloody, and realistic - although the battle of Blackwater probably utilized the best effects of the season. To me, Game of Thrones is not a perfect show - it has its slow points, its less engaging plot lines, its annoying characters - but I feel like it stands on a pedestal above so many television shows out there today. I'm glad it's getting the respect that it deserves - if you haven't already, I would highly advise you start watching it NOW."
2,5.0,"Who would of guessed the ante would be upped after the events of Season 1? One of HBO's finest moments, and an adventure you shouldn't dare miss!"
2,5.0,"Marvellous fantasy world, great plots, intriguing characters, great pictures!"
2,5.0,i needed something to fill the void of Breaking Bad. I found it.
2,5.0,fantastic last few episodes to end the season
2,4.5,It takes a bit of time to build up steam. But thanks to it's amazing cast and strong scripts. Season 2 raises the bar for all fantasy based shows.
2,5.0,things are getting better than ever
2,5.0,Game of Thrones continues to be the best show on TV with an absolutely stunning second season.
2,5.0,"The second season of this brilliant show gets even better and darker. This season is based on the second novel and goes in a different direction after the ending of the first season. House Stark is ready for war against House Lannister, while five kings are fighting for the Iron Throne. Just as violent as the first season, this season still doesn't shy away from anything. The cinematography and music are well done, as is the acting. Peter Dinklage proves that the role of Tyrion Lannister is still his, while Emilia Clarke is still perfect as Daenerys, this time depicting her as a constant fighter. The season continues with its surprises, with us wondering how the fates of each character will occur. Perfectly paced and wonderfully structured, this is fantasy like you've never seen it before and probably HBO's best TV Show."
2,4.5,"Greatly expanding on its storylines with several new characters and older characters that have now become major characters, Season 2 is grander and tenser."
2,5.0,this is a test review
2,5.0,The Blackwater episode is probably one of the finest hours in TV history.
2,4.5,Don't worry the dragons are coming you just have to wait one more season. This season is more dark but it's kind of slow and I mean a really slow build up.
2,5.0,"The first season was good, this season is fantastic."
2,5.0,"Laying the foundation for the next seasons, this ups the ante of the conflict and prepares the universe for the carnage to follow. This proved the series could adapt the books and encourage fans to flock to the show. The first season was not a smash hit, but with the word of fans like myself encouraged non fantasy fans to take the leap. 04/03/2019"
3,5.0,"Damn why did I wait so long after the show to finally watch, omg this show is phucking awesome"
3,4.5,"This is the season that definitely wins as the most shocking and different tv show season to date. It caught everyone by surprised and we finally started realizing, for real, what kind of a show this is. Re-watching it now after all these years, it still works well and hits hard."
3,5.0,"A maneira como ""Game of Thrones"" entrelaça política, poder e paixão é inigualável, tornando a série muito mais do que apenas um épico de fantasia."
3,5.0,Simply put the best season of television there ever was or will be.
3,5.0,"This is the season that Game of Thrones becomes phenomenal, this is the season that starts Game of Thrones on the journey to being the best show ever created."
3,5.0,Melhor série do mundo!
3,5.0,Incredible how the series manages to maintain the quality jon and tyrion are the best characters
3,4.0,"This series just keeps getting better and better each season! The more the world gets explored, the more interesting and engaging it gets!"
3,5.0,"The best ficition-drama ever right here. Props to George Martin, and D&D for adapting it."
3,5.0,My favorite episode in this season is the rains of castamere the episode just gime me shock and some how makes me cry
3,5.0,Writing : 10/10 Acting : 9/10 Cinematography : 10/10 Costume design : 10/10 Set design : 10/10 CGI Effects 8/10 Artistic vision 10/10 Adaptation ranking : 8/10
3,5.0,"About as fresh as any other season of GoT, total masterpiece."
3,5.0,Each season just gets better and better as it goes.
3,5.0,One of the best shows ever made.
3,5.0,Truly shocking season indeed but great storytelling and shock value! You can never tell what happens and your in it for the a surprise.
3,5.0,Fantastica temporada
3,1.0,Great story overshadowed by relentless chauvinism and tryhard shock value
3,4.5,"With the addition of season 3 and beyond, Game of Thrones has reached heavy popularity. Fan bases around the world are captivated by the exciting world of Westeros and the writing, directing, production, and score begin to deliver ""top shows of all time"" quality starting with this addition. In my opinion, the show still lacks in phenomenal acting at times."
3,5.0,"I liked this season also, is really really great, the characters are really good portraiyed."
3,4.5,"Game of Thrones continues to deliver top quality drama for adults, raising the stakes even higher and leaving viewers hungry for more."
3,5.0,Going to go down as the best piece of tv in history
3,5.0,Amazing season with a very unexpected direction. Stakes were sky-high and character building was perfect!
3,5.0,"Raising the stakes even higher while delivering unexpected thrills, the third season of this acclaimed show provides top-notch dramatic storytelling while also delivering immaculate performances, outstanding production, solid thematic depth and gripping action all amounting to an expertly paced narrative with glorious writing taking the diverse cast of characters in fresh and striking new directions."
3,5.0,"Wow when i thought this was amazing this season was mind blowing, again Keep going strong... 11/11"
3,3.0,"Not as good as the first two seasons. It has a LOT of storylines, as a result none of them get enough attention and makes the season feel like it breezes by with no real impact until The Rains of Castamere."
3,5.0,This show truly knows how to keep its viewers hooked
3,5.0,"The first three seasons of GoT are by far the best. Medieval in setting and tone, gritty and creative and genuine—faithful adaptations of Martin's brilliant work."
3,5.0,"And here you thought things couldn't possibly get any better after Season 2? Wrong. Season 3 features fantastic writing, great acting, crazy twists and turns like the best of emotional rollercoasters. What a joy!"
3,5.0,Awesome! Probably the best show ever.
3,5.0,Nice character development. Good adaptation.
3,5.0,This season had some amazing moments and very few flaws. Some of the events will be remembered in television history forever.
3,5.0,"Season 3 ended up as the magnum opus of the series, conceptualizing everything that made it great. Incredible drama, scenery, acting, and dialogue, backed by an unbelievably ballsy and gutsy move on several narrative characters. Truly one of the most gut punching, enthralling, and magnificent seasons of television ever put to screen."
3,5.0,"Few series quite as perfect as this one. Just one thing,,,,did winter ever really come?"
3,5.0,Absolutely brilliant loved it the mix of medieval theme and fantasy and white walkers horror it's brilliant and love it and the battle Sean's are amazing and brings the horror of battle to life like I've never seen before on a historical battlefields and dialogue all great
3,0.5,"For a show that advertisses a war there a lot of boring talking in the middle... Basically a Naruto 2, the problem is that the filler is in the middle of the episodes mixed in with actually relevant content, which makes you confused easily because the useless shit is mixed with the relevant shit... now tell me, how is that minimally enticing?"
3,5.0,One by one best season!!! Another one
3,4.5,"Somehow better than the previous seasons, while simultaneously setting up season four, season three is a masterpiece."
3,5.0,Am I allowed to say I never really liked Rob Stark all that much in any case?
3,5.0,So good. Must watch tv.
3,5.0,My rating for the s3 is a 9.4/10
3,4.0,"More Dragons please.,"
3,5.0,"Essa terceira temporada conseguiu ficar muito melhor que a segunda, em todos os aspectos. Esse poder que a Daenerys consegue com o exercito e com os três dragões é incrível de ver. O episódio The Rains of Castamere é um dos melhores episódios, muito marcante."
3,5.0,"Raising the stakes even higher while delivering unexpected thrills, the third season of this acclaimed show provides top-notch dramatic storytelling while also delivering immaculate performances, outstanding production, solid thematic depth and gripping action all amounting to an expertly paced narrative with glorious writing taking the diverse cast of characters in fresh and striking new directions."
3,5.0,esta temporada ofrece drama de calidad para adultos
3,5.0,Best season thus far. The show is bigger. The younger characters are grown up. The twists are crazy. The peaks are higher than Mt. Everest and the lows aren't even that low. Love this season so much.
3,4.5,"As great as season 1! The well-written story and dialogues continues, the relations between the highly diverse characters are set perfect in scene!"
3,5.0,O episódio do Casamento Vermelho é um dos momentos de maior impacto e imersão de uma série na história.
3,5.0,"Incredible show, at least till it follows the books. After it surpasses the books, problems start. Last season is best not mentioned."
3,5.0,They have established a great rivalry for most twistedly evil characters everCirce and Joffrey. This is why brothers and sisters should not make babies . The side plots all work and Jon and Yggritte work as a couple and not a dud in this season.
3,5.0,BRAN & JOJEN YYDS!!!
3,5.0,This season is arguably one of the best written things in the history of television. Everything has a purpose and the pace is perfect. Magnificent.
3,5.0,Absolutely the high point of the show for me personally. Some of the best episodes of anything I've seen. Great character development that just works incredibly well.
3,5.0,"Fantastic... Tyrion character is absolutely the best and well written. The Mother of Dragons is building army to rule like did her ancestors. Jon Snow back to Night's Watch, and Arya Stark was fabulous.. Valar Morghulis. And At end i left us shocked..."
3,4.5,The third (and fourth) season closely follows the third book with some major changes here and there. Great adaptation with memorable characters and episodes.
3,5.0,"Season 3, like season 2, keeps a very high quality. I loved this season."
3,5.0,Another great season
3,5.0,"Assim que Game of Thrones chega no terceiro ano, as coisas começam a ficar mais sombrias e interessantes, em termos de história. É quando temos o notório Casamento Vermelho, o instigante arco de Jon Snow infiltrado entre os Selvagens e também o início da decaída de Tyrion em Porto Real. Ganharia mais pontos não fosse a subtrama completamente gratuita que nos apresenta a Ramsay Bolton. E a sétima melhor temporada de Game of Thrones!"
3,5.0,"The show has found its rhythm by balancing a very large cast of characters by excluding even the most mayor ones from several episodes. This works however as the show now has by now truly mastered its level of unpredictability and drama meaning that whenever we do spend time with a character it serves a narrative purpose. Characters have always been morally grey, but it is explored more so in this season than ever before with a few characters developing in unexpected ways. The larger storylines also progress nicely without rush which helps give the series direction without detracting from the smaller narrative."
3,4.5,damn this show just gets better and better. my fav season yet
3,5.0,Far beyond great it's a masterpiece
3,5.0,This truly is a fantastic show that has the potential to forever alter the television landscape.
3,5.0,Great season with one of the best episodes in the season.
3,5.0,"The 3rd season of Game Of Thrones is the first season to earn a full 5/5 stars from me. This season is amazing, going much more into Daenerys' character, and has an EPIC season finale."
3,5.0,"The best show ever by far, it's just spectacular !!!"
3,5.0,"Game of Thrones S3 is the state of the art when it comes to television. Just superb, outstanding writing and acting."
3,2.5,"The cast tries its best to carry the show, but the writing is already becoming weak whereever it needs to deviate from the source material."
3,2.0,"Okay, let's get real. Without all the nudity and sex, we wouldn't even bother. The story is pretty much senseless. Still, gonna watch the rest!"
3,5.0,"what can i say!!! The serie continues with every single impressing thing that the others seasons already had, but add even more memorable moments per episode"
3,5.0,Probably the height of the game of thrones run and I enjoyed every second.
3,5.0,Who's going to die next? I don't even know
3,5.0,Game of Thrones Season 3 | Detailed note: 9.5
3,5.0,Shock after shock in so many episodes. Just generally great TV.
3,0.5,Most overrated show of all time I was waiting for some character or even just some welly filmed action but never got either in all of these seasons
3,5.0,"a much more complete season. Everything is good about this. at this point in this series, there is no way it could be any better, right?"
3,5.0,"this is unreal, so good"
3,5.0,"Even if u hated the ending this is by far the greatest show of all time. Each episode keeps u on the edge of your seat. Never have i ever heard as many people talk about whats gunna happen next week. There was just a lot of people upset because they didn't get what they want but that is what the whole show was, you never got what u want."
3,5.0,"Some masterpieces, which there is nothing like this in television, somehow find a way to increase their own quality and prestige. Unbelievably rich and powerful writing, acting, visual effects and storytelling. 9.8/10"
3,5.0,Nothing can be as same as it was till 9th episode!just freaking mindblowing amazing Great!
3,5.0,"My favorite season of the entire show. The writing gets EVEN better. I was afraid that the show would begin to feel a bit dragged on as they are basically continuing the story from season 2 but it never feels that way. I also think that the ending is truly amazing, with the Red Wedding. One thing I will say is that the Rains of Castamere that plays confused me the first as I had never heard the song before (unless they played it earlier in the season but I missed it). But aside from that it is an amazing episode and one of the most shocking moments in television, but it was done extremely well. Arya is also amazing, as well as Tyrion and Cersei."
3,3.5,Rating: 7/10. 72/100.
3,5.0,"best, it was really good, i enjoyed it. please give us no2 etc asap. as I WANT MORE !!!!"
3,5.0,"Stuffed with great journeys for all of the characters as well as some of the series' most shocking moments, season 3 continues Game of Thrones' strong early run. (A)"
3,5.0,"Although it felt a bit rushed at times, the story and acting was just spotless, with one of the most shocking moments in tv history executed perfectly in episode 9"
3,4.0,Another great GOT season with nice character development.
3,5.0,"An absolute masterpiece of fantasy television, including one of the most jaw-dropping plot twists ever aired on television. Truly fantastic."
3,5.0,Another great season. Another season of good fantasy tv that fans deserve.
3,5.0,"Mind was blown at key parts of this season, cementing my love of the series. Could not ask for more"
3,5.0,really in this you really know what game of thrones is
3,4.5,"It feels like they've finished with a lot of set up for several main storylines and now its all about the second act follow through, this show stays quite strong, even if there's an occasional misstep or plot hole created by neglecting parts of the source material."
3,5.0,"As close to perfect as it gets, just like season 2. Fantastic watch."
3,0.5,"The story of game of thrones is fake, wrong and family destroying. full of sad scenes like rape, killing innocent people, adult parts. all the people slept together.!!! Too bad"
3,5.0,"Beginning of the rise of Daenerys, MUST WATCH!"
3,5.0,Iconic and shocking moments abound in a story that has only been getting better so far. Nearly faultless television.
3,4.0,Amazing character arcs and overall story.
3,5.0,"Back and stronger then ever, Game of Thrones Third Season proves why it is the best show around. With dark twist and turn, the characters and their stories continue in the best way possible. The war continues and Season Three ends in the bloodiest way possible."
3,4.0,brutal los combates te enamora de los combates
3,5.0,"Really great actors, writing and well done special effects."
3,5.0,"Season 3 of Game of Thrones features some of the most incredible moments in television history (as well as fantasy history). One scene in particular, is probably the best that Game of Thrones has ever been in terms of writing and subverting tropes. This is the high point of the series by far!"
3,5.0,"Best show ever, at the time."
3,3.0,"For me this is the show's low point, where it revels the most in its HBO-iness - gratuitous sex and violence which serves virtually no point other than as a crutch for uneven storytelling."
3,4.5,Another great season from this fantasy epic!
3,5.0,Needless to say Season 3 was the most dramatic Season in the entirety of the show. The ending was almost as perfect as the beginning. Too many great moments for this not to be considered one of the best seasons in the show. In my opinion it's a tie between this or Season 4 for the best season in the show.
3,5.0,"This season was full of brilliant moments, both satisfying and traumatising. I think it's safe to say that any future weddings will be ruined for us."
3,5.0,"Season three takes a slower approach and sets up things to come in the fourth season, but that doesn't mean it's worse than season one or two in fact it's better than season two and has the shock value of season one with the red wedding. Season three delights and terrifies and will leave viewers wanting the fourth season..."
3,5.0,Game of Thrones continues to demonstrate Westeros's penchant for unforgiving brutality and cutthroat politics as the grim reality for all its central characters has only gotten colder.
3,5.0,TOO GOOD!!! PERFECTION IN EVERY SINGLE WAY!!!
3,5.0,"One of the best season of these show, fantastic!"
3,5.0,Another flawless season of GOT
3,5.0,the best season in the show shocks betrayal will have you on the edge of your seat
3,5.0,"This is an amazing season and sets us up perfectly with season 4. We get a lot of character development from Jon, Daenerys, and Arya. This season also has a good share of twists just like the other seasons before it. Daenerys is great in this season and we get to see her develop into the queen that she will become. We also see Theon tortured and turned into a whole different character."
3,2.5,Drawn out and the build up is not worth it.
3,5.0,"Game of Thrones season 3 is just another A+ season. Emilia Clarke, Peter Dinklage, Maisie Williams, Lena Headey, Charles Dance, Michelle Fairley, Sophie Turner, Richard Madden, Nikolaj Coster-Waldau, Rose Leslie, Carice van Houten, Kit Harington, Jack Gleeson, and Alfie Allen gave phenomenal leading performances. The supporting cast also gave wonderful performances especially from Diana Rigg, Gwendoline Christie, John Bradley, Rory McCann, Liam Cunningham, Natalia Tena, Natalie Dormer, Paul Kaye, and Jerome Flynn. The storytelling and writing continues to be terrific. The makeup effects were very impressive this season especially the White Walker, Jamie's cut wound, and all of the other stab and cut wounds. The visual effects were fantastic especially the three dragons, they are so awesome looking. The fighting scenes were excellent especially the fight scene between The Hound and Beric and the fight scene in episode 9. The music in this season was great especially the songs It""s Always Summer Under the Sea and The Bear and the Maiden Fair. Also the last scene of the season was great, it was cool to see Daenerys getting more people to help her. Game of Thrones just continues to be my 2nd favorite tv show of all time and this season was even better then the first two seasons."
3,5.0,I'll remember that episode for the rest of my life!
3,4.5,Great 3rd season GoT delivers a stunning story again! Tyrion continue to rock the show! Episode 9 blew me away! GoT is going to be one of the best shows on tv!
3,5.0,"If you are a fan of fantasy, and have not yet seen this season, then what are you doing?"
3,4.5,Hate what they've done to that many storylines with Arya jump. And all that Mary-Sue-thing thing about her.
3,5.0,This show is going to go down as one of HBO's best.
3,5.0,"Finally a show without those stupid Hollywoodish, PG-13 happy endings. Something serious."
3,5.0,"Keeps us coming back for more in this great universe, making us show all different kinds of emotion throughout the season."
3,1.0,this is no where near as good as fn
3,5.0,now we got dragons. the world is something new. lets see whats next.
3,4.5,"Bigger and certainly more ambitious than any season before it, Game of Thrones entertains with its big bloody clashes and at times shocking twists."
3,5.0,The books where amazing and the show is extremely engaging! Ps: Joffrey dodn't suffer enough!
3,5.0,"On par with the two first seasons, GOT manages to develop several parallel narratives with compelling characters and plots without rushing any storyline, while keeping its bold and unpredictable nature."
3,5.0,I need the book so bad. This did a good job
3,1.0,Adaption: Grade D Faithful of Source: No (Due not having 20 Episodes for Novel 1) Faithful of Characters: No (Due not having 20 Episodes for Novel 1)
3,5.0,Game of Thrones continues to tell a compelling and complex story in its third season.
3,5.0,"Story, Cast, Acting, VFX etc every is Tremendous also Most Realistically Written Series, Realism means nothing blurred or muted or cut e.g. Sex Scenes & violence Scenes which makes it different from other TV series & Amazing & Realistic... Also High Fantasy, Kings, Queen, Wars, White Walker (Snow Monsters) & Dragons Makes it Great High fantasy TV Series... To the point & Close to the Book, This TV series is Magnificent & Excellent, I Really Liked it Rated 10/10 Regards"
3,4.5,"And now season three... It has the same problems with season two, the only difference is the improved CGI, that's all!"
3,5.0,tell me a character this series don't have and i'm your
3,5.0,"Game of Thrones' third season cements itself as TV's strongest and most addicting fantasy as it earnestly doubles down on sumptuous production and refined character work, with more supernatural elements and unpredictable narratives than ever."
3,5.0,The best TV series of all time.
3,1.0,"Horrible. That is the word i would use to describe this season. The entire plot is based around a dragon lady massacring people, and every good guy that i was voting for dying. Overall this is a fairly horrible show with no plot,"
3,4.5,What..? What..? What..? Things turn around so fast.. You cannot find story as good as this. So good you need to keep your both eyes open.
3,2.5,"Although the episode of the Rains of Castemere is a great one, that does not make me forget that the story is a long going-on which in many moments goes nowhere."
3,4.5,"This season is even more pivotal because some characters are dead and some have to continue on there endless path. It is quite interesting to learn about these characters and watch these twists happen without much surprise. As stories get stale, the show moves on to different story lines and characters."
3,5.0,"This is probably the best season of the show. Just like the previous two seasons, poifect."
3,5.0,the best season of thrones
3,4.0,"Puntaje Original: 8.5 Talvez hasta ahora, la temporada con las escenas más sorprendentes que nos puede traer Game of Thrones; demostrándonos que esta serie nos puede dar unos giros inesperados de la mano de una narrativa extraordinaria jamás vista en la pantalla chica."
3,5.0,This season was gruesome but wonderful! The episode Rains of Castamere was the episode of the season.
3,5.0,"La serie ya es algo por encima de lo visto, el mayor giro de trama visto en cualquier pantalla, los personajes siguen desarrollandose excelente, los dragones están muy bien hechos y la historia ya es parte de la audiencia. Majestuoso."
3,5.0,The peak for the series. The show surprised tv viewers with no fear to kill off any character and end any storyline in a heartbeat with devastating consequences. Damn good season.
3,5.0,Game of Thrones: Season 3 Game of Thrones brings out their best for their third season. improved quality in storytelling and execution really force the audience to get infested in the franchise.
3,5.0,"In its most ambitious season to date, Game of Thrones came through once again. The twists continue to come, including one of the most shocking episodes in TV history."
3,5.0,"Game of Thrones continues to deliver top quality drama for adults, raising the stakes even higher and leaving viewers hungry for more."
3,5.0,The season that best captures the essence of the series and the one that contains the most emblematic scenes and the best episodes.
3,5.0,Keeps the train going by being amazing as ever.
3,5.0,"No other show I know compares, but dont try to do anything at all while youre watching it. Full attention required."
3,3.5,Starts off a bit slow but gets there in the end.
3,5.0,"Game of Thrones' third season doesn't simply deliver its best season to date, it further establishes the series as one of the finest on television, granting it a seat at the head of the television table that won't soon be relinquished. Just be warned - season three doesn't take prisoners, give viewers any quarter or pull a single punch. Brace for bloody, brutal impact and prepare to have the wind knocked out of your chest more than once."
3,5.0,the best thing ive ever seen.... ^_^
3,4.5,In the beginning there are good things about daenerys and this season finishes with interesting things about the house Lannister
3,4.0,"Puntaje Original: 8.5 Talvez hasta ahora, la temporada con las escenas más sorprendentes que nos puede traer Game of Thrones; demostrándonos que esta serie nos puede dar unos giros inesperados de la mano de una narrativa extraordinaria jamás vista en la pantalla chica."
3,0.5,"""but but but, it stop being boring after season 3...."""
3,5.0,"Another great season, what an amazing show"
3,5.0,Plot twists everywhere! Makes you want more than just an episode. Each character shines in his own ways.
3,2.5,"Predictable formula, copied storylines. Running on violence and sex by now."
3,5.0,Season 3 of Game of Thrones is incredible and is better than anything I've ever seen. Game of Thrones rules television.
3,5.0,It´s too good to be true. All the 10 episodes are great
3,5.0,"What I find most respectable and impressive about Benioff and Weiss's writing, especially illustrating itself in full force starting in the last part of this third season, is that they find entirely twisted and shocking ways to turn the story on its head and throw our expectations out the window. The impressive nature of the show's writing method, which hurls completely surprising story elements and extreme character reversals at the audience, is that it's not at all played for cheap shock by spinelessly pandering to the audience. There's a clear sense that, despite the truly shocking nature of the plot twists, the writers have full confidence in how all these big moments naturally and organically fit into the overall story of the TV series. ""Game of Thrones"" gets progressively better with each released season, and this season is far and away the best season yet, finally cementing your complete whole-hearted obsession with it that can not be broken anymore."
3,5.0,This is the best season of any series I have ever seen. It's not even close. The Red Wedding at the end of the season is the most shocking thing to ever grace my screen. It broke me in so many ways and it left me realising just how much I cared for all of these characters. I cannot see any other series getting anywhere near to this.
3,5.0,"Dramatic, well-acted, beautifully told, and just as incredible as the last two seasons, Game of Thrones rules still rules TV and is better than half of the movies out there today."
3,4.0,"HOLY SHIT THAT WAS DARK. Oh, the rest of the Season is pretty engaging, too, yes. I'll need a Phychologist, Though."
3,5.0,One of the greatest tv series of all time
3,5.0,"Beautiful, powerful, epic, stunning, and of course thrilling. Season 3 is another outstanding addition to this fantasy drama's library, and features plenty of twists and surprises of its own"
3,4.0,"Game of Thrones: season 3 is a refreshing continuation to its predecessor, because of its still unpredictable and well-written narrative bringing more welcomed bloody action."
3,4.0,"Game of Thrones: season 3 is a refreshing continuation to its predecessor, because of its still unpredictable and well-written narrative bringing more welcomed bloody action."
3,5.0,I don't think that my review of this Instant Classic matters.. This whole series is a must watch and the as a person who has read the book I would recommend it highly as the production is as good as the book!
3,5.0,growing differences but great transition of the important arcs
3,4.5,"This show cannot die! Deftly weaving through complex plots and characters, it somehow manages to keep everything very real and grounded. There are political plots, wars, revenge plots, tactics, and even some men and women of honour (gasp!) Some characters are simplified or changed from the books, which is to be expected. It does not impact the storytelling in any great way, and having the story presented in a visual medium actually helped me realize how certain plot points beat out. If youve read the books, you know that some parts *cough*Bran*cough* can drag on; they are mercifully cut down to the most interesting bits here."
3,5.0,Teaches you to be sceptical about weddings. The epicness continues to prevail through this amazing season.
3,5.0,"Game of Thrones reaches new heights in Season 3 with outstanding character arcs, great acting, and gut-wrenching plot twists."
3,4.5,"This adaptation (so far) is without a doubt the best I've ever seen. Few books ever make the transformation from script to screen without loosing something monstrously important to whomever has read it and taken it to heart. We can all reel them off.. HBO really have pulled it out of the bag with Game of Thrones. The sets, characters and costumes are perfect, they've even kept huge segments of dialog exactly the same. The location, the characters, the king's road, the dragon egg's, the mad king, the loyal friend, the bastards, the dwarfs, the traitors, the plotters, the unholy lovers, the pet-wolves, the night's watch, the WALL, the blue eyed spirits of the haunted forest, the prince with blonde hair, the tyranny surrounding the word Khal Drogo, the gulf of grief, the chameleon Baelish, and much much more! This show is so damn Good"
3,5.0,"Though it is not as strong as any of the seasons either side of it, there is still little doubt that entertainment did not come sparsely in this show. Few will forget the heartbreaking finale of episode 9."
3,4.5,"Game of Thrones establishes itself as a different attack on the fantasy genre. When you feel like the main characters are not going to die, they are going to die. That's how unpredictable this show is."
3,5.0,Season 3's Game of Thrones is a season that leaves us wanting more and it's a season that will never be forgotten.
3,5.0,This was simply an amazing season.Need I say more?
3,3.5,"The white and walking third season is coming, and it is a wild one. Game of Thrones has gone so far that every event that come to pass, and all interaction between the characters; is adored by myself. To keep it short; this third season is everything the first and the second isn't. The first two feels like a backstory to everything, to get the audience feel the characters and really endure everything. Nothing really big seems to happen though, just small non-important boring **** But this third, ohh yes! When I saw the first episodes, I was totally convinced, something big is coming in the future episodes! I never got to feel that in the previous seasons. That, and all the less amount of action is another aspect. The tempo is much higher; fear and terror is upon every individual in the show, so fascinating! The plot still got some slowness though, but since my love of the characters has become greater; is it still enjoyable! I also feel that this third season got much more and better humor, music and exiting events. There're even some plot-twists, which are the magical ingredients to make a stunning TV-show. The dialogs are another aspect, they are much more enjoyable and less boring. I especially enjoyed the season finale, so eventful but also sad. That uniqueness is something extra! So yes, this is a much greater season of the overrated show called Game of Thrones. It still got it flaws though, especially when it comes to action and long term entertainment. But I really enjoyed this season, but I still hate that they doesn't show that much action. My overall rating for each episode is 6.98; which is a much higher rating than in season 2. I'm therefor giving Game of Thrones: Season 3 a 7/10. 7/10"
3,5.0,It just gets better and better.
3,5.0,"The series is picking up, with much more involvement from all story arcs. Excellent acting and pacing as always."
3,4.0,Season 3 lived up to the standard of previous seasons but had a focus on shock values (pretty predictable really). Each episode had really great quality and didn't feel like they were dragging the show on.
3,5.0,"Game of Thrones continues to abuse, never allowing the audience's desired outcome to happen while keeping viewers too interested to stop watching."
3,5.0,A slower pace season but with the biggest pay-off of them all.
3,4.0,GoT held me and never let me go.
3,3.5,"DAMN LANNISTERS!!! Here's my problem with GoT: The few episodes I saw at my friend's place just so happened to be the best episodes (Ned's death, the Red Wedding, Bear fighting, and the one of three kings decapitating the other two for the mother of dragons). But when watching the series in it' entirety, it is often rather slow. What looked epic and awesome on few viewings turned into just a decent show as a whole. I still like it, but it's not living up to expectations. I'm waiting for more from the dragons."
3,5.0,"With the third season, Game of thrones solidified it's position as one of the best shows to exist."
3,5.0,best fantasy tv series
3,5.0,"The third season of GOT is stronger than the predecessors, with a more solid script and the same excellent performances by all of it's cast and a beautifull imagery, making the public pass an excellent time."
3,4.5,"Best season of the series, thus far."
3,3.5,"Not as strong as the seasons either side of it, but still some of the best viewing on television."
3,5.0,100% The most epic TV serie of all-time.
3,2.5,"Season Info The War of the Five Kings continues to claim more victims, as Stannis Baratheon (Stephen Dillane) licks his wounds after a humiliating defeat and Robb Stark (Richard Madden) pushes for a risky offensive against the Lannisters. In other plotlines, Joffrey plans to marry Margaery (Natalie Dormer), Daenerys (Emilia Clarke) works to liberate a city whose economy is built on slavery and Jon Snow (Kit Harington) finds his undercover mission complicated when he falls in love with a woman from the tribe living beyond the wall."
3,4.0,"""Game of Thrones: Season 3"" has everything you could want: well-developed characters, good dialogue, great acting, exciting action, and one extremely shocking episode."
3,5.0,"Game of Thrones is the best historical - fantasy series I have ever seen. The film is a story about five kingdoms, fighting amoung themselvs. Action is fast and very suprising. Who wants in a film drama, tension, love and betrayal this is the movie for him."
3,4.5,"Ominous, blood-drenched & powerful in its story, Game of Thrones Season 3 continues the momentum and provides its best season to date. Continuous thrills and complexities combined with the ensembles outstanding performances slays competition and assumes the series' position as king of all drama shows. 4.5/5"
3,3.0,"Overrated show, I really don't get why this got so much hype, the books may be good but the show is'nt even close to good IMO"
3,5.0,"probably the best season so far, season 4 was good also. big improvement in my opinion on season 2 (which was still great).... normally when i re-watch episodes from the 4 seasons i most often watch episodes from season 3, I like how she gets the unsullied and frees all the slaves. and we get to hear low and high valayrian. and the red wedding...such a shock if you havent read a storm of swords. glad catelyns dead she was so mean to jon"
3,5.0,The best season so far.
3,5.0,"This season continued Game of Thrones' reputation of no character is safe in one of the most shocking, brutal, and devastating moments in the history of Television. Great acting performances, fantastic writing, and some damn good directing make this such a memorable TV show it is almost impossible to stop watching."
3,4.5,"Because it only adapts the first half of Storm of Swords, the third season feels incomplete, but is still amongst the best on television."
3,4.0,"Most of the episodes had pacing issues, but it has one of the most memorable episodes on the show. Favorite episodes: 4, 8, 9."
3,4.5,Alfie Allen did an amazing job as Barristan Selmy! Want to see more of his skills!
3,5.0,So addicting. Intense and fun to watch show.
3,4.5,"While it still contains a bit too much and includes a suprisingly ""only decent"" season finale, Season 3 still brings alot of amazing and tense moments, great and interesting stories and one of the best moments to ever grace television."
3,4.5,"Every bit as stunning as its reputation suggests, the third season in Game of Thrones upholds the quality of its preceding installments that play out more like an epic film series than a televised soap opera, due to its intelligent writing, huge cast of well developed characters, and a constantly tense atmosphere."
3,5.0,"The best season yet for Game of Thrones, full of twists and featuring two episodes that are most likely the show's finests so far."
3,5.0,"More strong points, twists, and unexpected turns. In it's Third Season, Game of Thrones getting even more powerful, with beautiful sets and fantastic characterizations."
3,5.0,Two words: Red Wedding
3,4.0,Red Wedding cracks me up every time but pretty damn good for most of the season
3,5.0,It's like Middle Earth but with more tits and wine. And that Red Wedding is gonna haunt me til the rest of my days.
3,1.5,"The third season was boring as hell, if Senfield was the show about nothing, then this season was the season of nothing at all. The best episode was the 9th one."
3,5.0,"The best and the most unpredictable season up until now! It incredibly left the viewers (particularly, me) craving for more!"
3,4.0,"However epic the red wedding was, the season as a whole was a bit inconsistent with respect to its previous installments."
3,5.0,One of the best seasons of any television series of all time.
3,5.0,Love everything about this series. the only bad thing is that there are not enough episodes to watch and it ends too soon.
3,5.0,"As a reader of Martin's books, I knew what was going to happen this season before it happened. Most of the season is a superbly done build up that is meant to trick the audience into believing that the Starks might make a comeback, but then abruptly turns at the last minute into a massacre that leaves Robb Stark, his mother, his wife and unborn child, and all of his army dead. As I said before, I knew this was going to happen but it still shocked me with how vividly it shows some of the arguably last decent people in Westeros being absolutely destroyed in the most horrifying way possible. I wouldn't be shocked if it was the most violent scene in television history and I am sure it will remain infamous for many years to come. Game of Thrones has a sort of torturous relationship with its viewers that is actually reflected this season with Ramsay Snow's torturing of Theon Greyjoy. Its painful to watch sometimes, but we sometimes enjoy watching the suffering as much as Ramsay does."
3,4.0,would be 4.5 though.....episode 9 :'(
3,5.0,First season got me addicted; second season left me disappointed; third season proves why this is one of the greatest shows ever made.
3,3.5,"With the end of season two being so ridiculously epic, season three slows down to a crawl for the most part. For the first time, the monotonous plotting gets boring. Don't get me wrong, it's still a good season of television that builds on the others, but it's no where near as good. Everyone points to the red wedding as one of the greatest surprises in television history, but I disagree. Even if it was, it's only one episode, and one episode has never made a season."
3,4.5,"Where certain film properties or television programs begin to lose a step or two during its third iteration, Season 3 of HBO's Game of Thrones brushes off that theory and we learn what came before it was simply a warm-up. Season 1 had the daunting task of establishing a fantasy world that wasn't too distant to relate to (or invest in), Season 2 broke away from the establishment and spread everything out to scratch the surface (and scope) of the world (promised from the opening credits of each episode) and Season 3 (somehow) managed to do all of that while expanding mythos, characterization and more importantly, entertainment. A new sense of tone within the writing and directing of Season 3 deepens the engagement, so when more off-kilter story threads are introduced (Giants, ""Wargs,"" Jamie Lannister's likability...), it doesn't come off as farce (or forced). More impressive is that when these elements are presented, the amazing attention to detail from seasons past pays off immaculately to make it hard not to appreciate the foresight from the filmmaking team. Whereas Season 2 felt a little stagnant, Season 3 has almost perfect pacing to juggle the constantly rising cast and all the melodramatic events that unfold before them, so when dragons roam the skies, allegiances are made, and blood is spilt, Game of Thrones promises it is here to stay and will entice (and torment) in ample supply."
3,5.0,"Upto episode 9 season3 was a bit of let down from season 2. But then ""Rains of Castarmere"" happens . I already knew about the season finale but it still managed to raise the hairs on the back of my neck . ""Rains of Castarmere"" makes into my list of best season finale"
3,5.0,This show is LEGENDARY! =D All though I do feel like there are too many characters because I like certain characters more than the others but its still my favorite show.
3,5.0,"As richly rewarding and utterly enthralling as season 2, with upped stakes and dark and captivating character arcs that flesh out the cast, particularly the intriguing Lannister house."
3,5.0,"The only reason why I saw Game of Thrones at first was because Sean Bean was in it. With his absence in the subsequent seasons, I felt a bit uninterested about this series. But still it provides unmatchable thrills and plot elements. The dram, the story, the action and the verbal references of histories and all are simply mesmerising. Also, what was the ending of the second last episode of this season. The twists are simply unpredictable."
3,5.0,"GOT is as emotionally manipulative as ever, and manages to come out on top after a shaky second season."
3,5.0,"Season 3 steps the show up a notch with a more intriguing storyline, better visuals, a dark premise and jaw dropping situations occurring in essentially every episode. Fear The Rains of Castamere..."
3,5.0,I love a show (book) that portrays characters as real people. Not everyone is 100% good or bad. This series has also spoiled all other tv for me. Bi keep wanting more people to get killed off. It creates so much chaos!
3,4.5,"One of the best shows on television currently. Great acting, storyline, character arcs and of course...dragons. The only downside is that you have to watch it from beginning to end or else you won't be able to keep up with all the characters and their subsequent narratives. Also, everyone dies."
3,4.5,"Game of thrones has always delivered from season to season with its outstanding drama and scale. And i season three they continue to raise the bar, its bloodier, Grittier, and continues to leave me wanting more. With the cast giving the bests performances ever in Television its hard to believe this isn't a very long film. Game of thrones will continue to deliver until the credits role at the end of season 3."
3,1.0,ARE YOU KIDDING ME!!!!???? This 3rd season was the worst of the 3 BY FAR Please stop ruining a show with a priceless first season.. I should say stop milking it.. TAKE SOME CHANCES YOU BOOBS@@!!!!!!
3,5.0,I thought I saw the best from television with the second season. I was wrong.
3,4.5,"With more actions and elevated ambitions, GoT Season 3 is by far the most riveting."
3,5.0,"Once again this show gets even better and darker. Based roughly on the first half of the third book, A Storm of Swords, this season offers unexpected surprises and an entirely different storyline for some of its characters. Jon Snow meets the King Beyond the Wall; Tyrion attempts to fight for his safety; Daenerys attempts to find an army to aid her in taking back the throne; the Stark family still fights for justice against the Lannisters. The season in a way gets us ready for what the fourth season will be like, which is said to be based on the second half of the third book. The show still proves itself as being amazing, with the actors still proving that the roles are fully theirs, in particular Peter Dinklage, Emilia Clarke, Lena Headey, Michelle Fairley, Kit Harrington, Richard Madden and Charles Dance. The guest cast is also perfect, in particular Ciaran Hinds who only appears in three episodes. As with the first two seasons, the ninth episode is the big one with the unexpected twist, which is even darker than the first season. With that great twist and the great cliffhanger ending, this season proves why this is HBO's best show to date. Fantastic."
3,5.0,The third season shows no signs of slowing down. In fact Season three ramps up the magical elements and the tragedy to new heights. It defies your expectations time and time again. Every episode transports you to a beautifully realized fantasy world with its own history and complex flawed characters. The story is complex and at times hard to follow if your not paying attention to every episode but it comes together perfectly and is more than worth the investment of time but only if you can stomach the series often extreme violence and dark places its willing to go
3,5.0,"The most well realized and polished Season so far (which is saying a lot, since what came before was already excellent), this is an unbelievable game changer at every turn. Most people will remember this Season because of the infamous Episode 09 but everything before and after is brilliant, showcasing the talent at everyone involved in this show. As a book reader of A Song Of Ice And Fire, I can tell you with confidence that the next Season is gonna top this one, easily. Is that even possible? You bet."
3,4.5,An epic journey during medieval times. Great cast of actors. Can be overwhelming with so many characters and kingdoms. Just as you think you figured one out by time they get back to the story line you forgot and can be frustrating. I had to start with Season 3 and move backwards to Season 2 and now watching season 1.
3,5.0,You guys Kidding. Its getting better and better everyday. OMG.. I desperately want to watch season 4.. waitng for it. GOT is the best TV series ever.
3,5.0,can this show get any better. starks are morans
3,5.0,"I'll admit that while GoT has always interested me, I hadn't entirely felt invested in it's characters (they're from some made up fantasy world!). This season, however, came off as even more human amidst it's fantastic elements, and it's penultimate episode quickly became the most talked-about one of the tv year (with the possible exception being Breaking Bad's Ozymandias). GoT can now be mentioned in the same breath as shows like The Sopranos and Deadwood, as being a masterfully concocted HBO hallmark."
3,5.0,Nothing on TV or big screen in better than GAME OF THRONES. I'm glad that I'm alive to witness this epic program on TV. forever grateful....
3,5.0,"Game of Thrones continues to be the pinnacle of television entertainment, with this season's episode 9 managing to trump even the previous two."
3,4.5,"This is by far one of the best series to hit TV. With so much good writing on TV these days, most movies can't compete."
3,4.5,"Slowing down just a teensy bit compared to the previous season, yet still maintaining a level of quality fit for the best show on HBO."
3,5.0,The only reason to have HBO.
3,5.0,"As the series progresses, it begins as 90% realistic and 10% fantasy. A take on Tolkien's Lord of the Rings but on a whole other level. It can be quite addicting and it's fun to have the books around because you can read 60 - 100 pages that week before the episode premieres. If you don't read the books, it's like you're watching Lost and 24 figuring out who might die in each episode and it's unpredictable! This show is bloody brilliant. I'm late on watching it but I am amazed and would have to say this is all my time favorite TV show!"
3,5.0,I subscribe to HBO almost just for this series (True detective now too)....yes its that good watch it from the beginning and then you will understand! One of the best series in my 50 years on this planet.
3,5.0,"The only show that can go toe-to-toe against Breaking Bad in my personal opinion. Fantastic season, leaving me eagerly anticipating future seasons in the franchise."
3,5.0,"Still LOVE the stories, plots, characters, outfits, languages, cultures, picturesque landscapes. What will happen next!!??"
3,4.5,"People have been saying""Breaking bad"" is the best show recently but I'd say this is. Game of thrones tells the story of people trying to rise and stay in power in a highly developed fantasy world. The world created by this show is incredible and fantastical, there are many different cities each with its own culture, religion, sayings, weapons, foods, et cetera. Most of the show takes place in Westeros which is mainly based on medieval Europe but even inside Westeros there is a lot of variant; Winterfell is filled with snow, and worship the old gods, but Kings Landing is hot and only worship the new gods. There are many other cities you get to see that are all vastly different in Westeros but one place I really want to talk about is The Wall. The Wall is a very long, tall wall of ice stretching over 700feet tall meant to keep out mysterious forces, and the people who work there are made out to be brave men but are in all reality mostly criminals who were given the option to go there or be executed. You see the show through the perspective of characters, and that's where this shows greatest strength lies. You see everyone's motivations, and they're all very believable which is why you can believe the fantasy setting. It's easy for you to love some of these characters and hate others, a lot of them deliver great quotes too. I don't want to talk about the plot because I don't want to give anything away. You might just have to take my word that it's great. My biggest gripe with this show is that it's hard to follow at the beginning because of all of the families and characters you'll have to learn. This problem goes away by season 2, but be sure to pay close attention to the names and dialogue. Overall awesome show."
3,5.0,"One of the best TV series in 2013, without any doubt."
3,5.0,"Thrones showed the Borgias who is boss by ousting the rival show in short time. I did like The Borgias but if one had to go I'm glad Thrones survived. Multiple story lines going on for power of the iron throne is the basic storyline. The only draw back about this series is they don't seem to have enough time to tell stories for all parts. The show quickly runs out of time and sometimes it takes weeks for find out what is going on with one set of characters. They also do not spend nearly enough time on Daenerys, she should be the showcase of the show."
3,4.5,It can get way too violent at times. But season three has you on the edge of your seat for the whole season and continues to break new ground in television
3,5.0,Hands down the best series I have ever watched. Love the characters and the cinematography.
3,4.5,"Amazing, spectacular, wonderful, and leaves you craving more. The cast does a great job, the soundtrack is great, and there are no cheesy elements (which I find to be a huge epidemic in television). The story is wonderful yet ever so sad, and although it may not stay true to the books 100% I personally like it better."
3,5.0,"I love each season this show has brought. I really not a fan of sex scene, but its HBO."
3,5.0,The best tv series in television period.
3,4.5,"More epic in scale and with another fantastic and unforgettable twist of a conclusion, Season 3 invests more in emotion and successfully pulls off interesting (and intertwining) storylines."
3,5.0,"Best season of the 3. They are all amazing anyway, but if I had to pick one it would be season 3 :)."
3,5.0,Thrones is getting better and better.
3,5.0,"Season 3 is, quite possibly, the best season of Game of Thrones thus far. It's here that you see the events unfolding are not just affecting the Starks, and the previous ones seemed to do, but everyone living in Westeros. The crowning achievement was the Red Wedding, which changed everything."
3,5.0,"Okay the dragons are here but what about the ice zombies. This season is big and awesome but the red wedding was brutal to watch, The acting and the whole cast did a fantastic Job in there roles."
3,5.0,"Now that I just finished the first two seasons I'm seriously surprised. This TV show is truly something to be amazed about! Right now I'm really trying to find a flaw in it but I just can't. I thought of everything, the pacing, the cast, the direction and I even dared to question the amazing production value! But i couldn't find a single main thing, maybe the occasional out of pace scene but nothing to distract you if this amazing journey. Let's start with the plot, it is an adaptation of the famous series of novels A Song of Ice and Fire from George R. R. Martin. Like you guessed I haven't read them but I'll congratulate George for such a deep and rich universe and characters! But you are gonna ask, can this show really pull you into this story and make you like the protagonists? The answer is: ABSOLUTELY! I found myself cheering for Tyrion as he led his forces in Blackwater Bay! I liked hating Joffrey's guts and seeing what other horrible things he could do! And I liked immersing myself in Jon Snow's journey to the mysterious and wild lands that lie North of the Wall! The story is so engaging and it never gets lost in the overwhelmingly big cast of characters. There were a few times where I said ""woah, who was this?"" or ""what was this dudes name?"", but nothing overly complicated. The actors are great, they are full of charm and fit the characters. The ones that really stood out where Peter Dinklage as the smart and cunning Tyrion Lannister, Sean Bean as the honorable and loyal Ned Stark and last but not least, Jack Gleeson, playing the and sometimes chilling Joffrey Baratheon! Another thing I want to talk about is the astonishing and amazingly crafted presentation. It takes you in... no, it sucks you into this world and makes you care about it and feel part of it. I swear every time I see it I just sit back and enjoy my time in Westeros."
3,4.5,The most interesting serial which i every saw
3,5.0,This season contains the most tragic scene I have ever seen on television.
3,4.5,"The conquests of Danaerys Targaryen, the Red Wedding and the continuing travels of Arya Stark make Season 3 stunning and engaging."
3,5.0,"Season 3 of Game of Thrones is easily the best, with Rains of Castamere one of the best episodes."
3,5.0,Best season of the show
4,4.5,Another excellent season with A LOT of things happening and some amazing scenes. This is peak TV and I'm glad to rewatch it some 10 years after it originally aired - still holds water.
4,5.0,"A evolução dos personagens, de Tyrion Lannister a Arya Stark, foi magistralmente apresentada, permitindo que os espectadores se conectassem profundamente com suas jornadas."

4,5.0,"The greatest season of television. Packed with amazing, acting, drama, action, suspense, and story."
4,5.0,"The most epic season so far, absolutely brilliant and satisfying."
4,4.5,Writing : 10/10 Acting : 10/10 Cinematography : 9/10 Costume design : 10/10 Set design : 10/10 CGI Effects 9/10 Artistic vision 10/10 Adaptation ranking : 9/10
4,5.0,the fucking season this was really the best season for got
4,5.0,One of the greatest shows ever made.
4,5.0,"While the 1st-3rd season focus on a lot of shock value, season 4 features a lot of satisfying episodes. Very moving, more fast paced, and action!"
4,5.0,This season was the best! One the entire game of thrones saga
4,1.0,Great story overshadowed by relentless chauvinism and tryhard shock value
4,4.5,"Season 4 is very exciting and continues to build on all the material from seasons 1-3. Game of Thrones continues into ""Best of all time"" territory in show rankings."
4,5.0,"Really great adaptation, i loved the cast."
4,4.5,"Game of Thrones continues to be one of the best shows on TV, combining meticulously-plotted character arcs with the spectacular design of the Seven Kingdoms."
4,5.0,"The best season of the entire show, so upsetting it all goes down hill after"
4,5.0,"Upping the ante in every possible way, Game of Thrones continues to bring us fantastic character development, astonishing performance, glamorous production, gripping athmosphere and bloody intense action sequences- all attached by an amazingly written, perfectly paced narrative with so much drama and surprises that leave you hungry for more."
4,5.0,Keep going fucking strong... GOT is top notch series....
4,5.0,Flawless and well acted!
4,4.0,"Season 4 is where GoT starts to change for the worse, and it's noticeable. Yet, this season is still a good one, within a number of standout moments."
4,5.0,"Awesome! This season still features clever and witty dialogue, great writing overall, crazy twists (did somebody say ""The Mountain and the Viper""?) and immense suspension combined with beautiful cinematography. Must see!"
4,5.0,"No matter what the content in this show is, I will always give it five stars because Kit Harington never let me down."
4,5.0,Awesome! Probably the best show ever.
4,4.5,Arguably the best season of the show. The story and character arcs were so well done. The actors grew into the roles outside of Heady who peaked in season 1.
4,5.0,"It seemed impossible to follow up the greatness of season 3 in any meaningful way, yet season 4 managed to do so in a dutiful manner that Eddard himself would be proud of. Somehow, the series manages to be increasingly complex, managing so many storylines that we have become invested in at this point, and amplifying it even further than we ever could have hoped. The quality of season 4 is a true testament to the impressiveness of the series as a whole more than any other factor could hope to be. There was no reasonable way that it could match and deliver on expectations established previously. Yet, in spite of all of the odds, it does so in a potentially more captivating manner. Other than Breaking Bad, I don't know that I'll ever see television truly as great as this again in my lifetime. I absolutely hope that I do, but I just cannot imagine anything can match what this series has done for me."
4,5.0,"Few series quite as perfect as this one. Just one thing,,,,did winter ever really come?"
4,5.0,Absolutely brilliant loved it the mix of medieval theme and fantasy and white walkers horror it's brilliant and love it and the battle Sean's are amazing and brings the horror of battle to life like I've never seen before on a historical battlefields and dialogue all great
4,0.5,I'd rather watch hipoppotamus taking a shit... to be honest it's more entretaining that whatever this pile of garbage is.
4,5.0,Epicccccc !!!! What a season
4,5.0,"One of the greatest television seasons of all time, season four feels like the end of an era for Game of Thrones."
4,5.0,"Game Of Thrones se va volviendo en el mejor programa de television, combinando arcos de personajes dejandote con ganas de mas"
4,5.0,Oberin almost makes up for Joffrey. Almost. Every show needs a good villain.
4,5.0,It is crazy how good this show is.
4,5.0,My rating for the s4 is a 9.5/10
4,5.0,I'm watching the entire season again and I am happy I bought it! I forgot how entertaining this really was!
4,5.0,Just phenomenal in every way. Solidified Game of Thrones as one of the greatest shows ever.
4,5.0,best season of the show probably one of if not the best season in all of tv
4,4.0,"The HBO show ""Game of Thrones"" is a television series about many different characters who are fighting for the Iron Throne of the Seven Kingdoms to become the ruler of all. The major families, the Lannisters, the Starks, and the Targaryens along with others, fight and destroy each other whether the consequences end in death or life. Despite all of the underlying plots in the series, the representation of disability is greatly shown throughout the entire show. There are many characters who have disabilities such as Hodor, a man with an intellectual disability. Bran, a boy who gets thrown off a tower and ends up unable to walk ever again. Jaime Lannister, who gets his hand chopped off and left with a metal prosthetic as a replacement. But, one of the main characters is a man named Tyrion Lannister, played by Peter Dinklage, who played a dwarf. Tyrion grew up with a deeply ableist family who treated him extremely poorly because he is a dwarf or who they refer to as a ""monster"" along with also being blamed for killing their mother because she died while giving birth to Tyrion. This show does a great job of representing disabled people in movies and television with an actual actor who is disabled. The actor who plays Tyrion Lannister is a dwarf in real life and there is no one better to play someone with a disability than an actor with the disability itself. It is known that movies and television continue to let others portray someone who they are actually not, such as when a white person plays the role of a black character in a movie. An actor and the president of Little People of America, Mark Povinelli who is also a dwarf, says ""It's so rare to see someone with dwarfism as having a fully dimensional character. ""So often, in the entertainment industry, we are painted — as well as many people with disabilities — in two ways. One is disability porn — where we're some helpless creature that some average-height person needs to save. Or we're some villain, mad about their height and can't get over it, and therefore lashes out at everyone. There's very little middle ground."" The 1932 film ""Freaks"", about a group of disabled circus ""freaks"", made a statement about inclusivity of the disabled and it got so much backlash because society couldn't accept the diversity. But, the film ""Freaks"" just like ""Game of Thrones"" shows society that disabled people are greatly discriminated against and disrespected, but are human-beings too who should be allowed to be shown on screen and represent who they are in their characters. The show does make a great deal of making it known of the stereotypes and discriminations that people say about disabled people, mostly Tyrion Lannister because of his dwarfism. In season 4, episode 4 there is a scene where Cersei Lannister, his sister, and Jaime Lannister, his brother, are discussing Tyrion because Cersei thinks that Tyrion killed their son, Joffrey with poison. Cersei says, ""that creature murdered our son and you've always pitied him"" indicating that Jaime is pitying Tyrion because of his disability. Cersei continuously refers to Tyrion as a ""monster"", ""creature"" and even ""imp"". All of these degrading words are nothing of who Tyrion really is represented as, which is intelligent and a person with great dignity. From the excerpt from ""Screening Stereotypes"", the writer says, ""The most obvious feature of monster characterization is their extremism. The physical disabilities typically involve disfigurement of the face and head and gross deformity of the body."" (Longmore, pg. 135) Cersei sees Tyrion as this ""gross deformity"" and treats him with no respect. It's especially nice to see that Tyrion's character is also seen as an equal to many other characters and is more than capable of being treated as a regular human-being rather than this ""monster"" that most think. Tyrion's disability doesn't get in the way of him ever expressing his sexuality and how he explores it. He is capable of real feelings just as everyone else has. Tyrion's character has an obsession with sex and goes to brothel's very frequently. But, he ends up falling in love with a woman named Shae and she reciprocates this love back to him. She never mentions that he is a dwarf and never mentions anything about his disability as a problem that could arise in their relationship. Their relationship focuses on serious matters This shows that disabled people can have real relationships and real human companionship whether people don't believe it's possible or wrong. Everyone deserves to love and be loved, especially disabled people. Not only does Tyrion have genuine relationships, but genuine friendships. His friendship to his brother Jaime Lannister is an example of how a family member should love and respect someone no matter their disability. In season 4 episode 3, Cersei tells Jaime, ""I want our little brother dead."" Jaime responds saying, ""But he's our brother."" Cersei then goes on to say how Tyrion was born a menace and that they should've killed him the moment he was born. She explains Tyrion's birth and how shocked everyone was to see a deformed child. And that he was probably going to grow up as a killer and a nuisance anyways. Jaime says, ""But you can't hate him for being born that way, it wasn't his fault."" Tyrion was being looked at as if it was his fault that he has a disability, but that is never true with any disabled person. He was getting sought out from birth as this evil villian who is going to end up killing everyone because of his deformity. ""Furthering the depiction of the disabled person as a ""monster"" and the criminal characterization both express to varying degrees the notion that disability involves the loss of an essential part of one's humanity."" (Longmore, pg. 135) Overall, I think that ""Game of Thrones"" does a great job of showing the inclusivity of disabled characters. This show portrays a disabled character as a strong and independent man who the audience can look up to and cheer for in the end. It shows that disabled people can be respected and played correctly and truly by a dwarf themself. Tyrion's character development goes from being abused by the world to being loved and surrounded by the right type of people that he needed."
4,3.5,very good season i had so much fun watchd that
4,5.0,"Upping the ante in every possible way, Game of Thrones continues to bring us fantastic character development, astonishing performance, glamorous production, gripping athmosphere and bloody intense action sequences- all attached by an amazingly written, perfectly paced narrative with so much drama and surprises that leave you hungry for more."
4,5.0,Nessa temporada o aproveitamento dos personagens ainda continua muito bom. Excelente temporada!

4,5.0,"This is where it peaked: television as it ought to be, as GRRM would say."
4,5.0,"Peak television. Tyrion is soooo good. Tywin is soooo good. Oberyn, Jon, and Arya are soooo good. Everything comes together for a phenomenal beginning, middle and end. Easily the best season of television ever."

4,5.0,"Todos os personagens de GoT são bem aproveitados e cumprem muito bem seu papel, deixando a série com um toque único."
4,5.0,"Incredible show, at least till it follows the books. After it surpasses the books, problems start. Last season is best not mentioned."
4,5.0,THE SILENT BOLSHEVIK
4,4.5,"The show still retains its strongest aspects with some of the best acting to date (especially by Peter Dinklage). While the season at its best rivals any moment in the show, unfortunately there are also a larger portion of the story where it's just spinning its wheels boiling down to about one significant plot development per episode. This isn't necessarily a bad thing we get to explore the character's quite thoroughly this way. Still so much of it is just referencing earlier events without adding anything substantial that you could easily cut a lot of it."
4,5.0,"This was Game of Thrones at its peak. Season 4 has displayed some of the most well-written, gut-wrenching moments the show has to offer. All plotlines were intriguing with amazing dynamics between the characters. One of HBO's finest works."

4,5.0,One of the best seasons
4,5.0,"Still remains some of the best media I've ever seen. Great character development and really invests you into the characters. The show also expands into talking about Dorne, which makes the world feel much more vibrant. The last few episodes are some of the best in the series period."
4,5.0,"Best Season So far.. The King is gone. Tyrion's Court scene, The Wilding's Attack, The white walkers everything this seasons has to entertain and to live the show."
4,4.5,The fourth season closely follows the third book with some major changes here and there. Great adaptation with memorable characters and episodes. The series has become bigger and more epic than ever before.
4,5.0,The series continues to keep the quality of the previous seasons and keeps the level of the show as one of the best ever made.
4,5.0,I really love it it's like really good
4,5.0,"Hands down, the best season of the whole series!"
4,5.0,"Essa é a picanha de Game of Thrones. Seguindo os eventos chocantes da terceira temporada, o quarto ano se beneficia por ter o melhor trecho de A Tormenta das Espadas para adaptar, que incluem momentos brilhantes como o Casamento Púrpuro, a trama envolvendo a acusação de Tyrion, a invasão dos Selvagens à Muralha e o inesquecível Príncipe Oberyn Martell, um dos personagens mais memoráveis. Impecável em roteiro, direção e grandes batalhas. Uma temporada simplesmente perfeita. E a melhor temporada de Game of Thrones!"
4,4.5,just as good as the third season.
4,5.0,Some of the best moments of television can be found herein.
4,5.0,"So far, the best season in this show, great story. This season holds some of the best moments and episodes in the whole show."
4,5.0,"This season has the death of Ygritte which is pretty sad, but it's delivered in such a GREAT way. S4. Ep9 is one of the best episodes of the series."
4,5.0,"Game of Thrones S4 continues the show's amazing hot streak of getting its audience astonished. Continuing the events of the third book in GRRM's ""A Song of Ice and Fire"", we see epic events and heartbreaking moments. Just incredible."
4,5.0,"The best show ever by far, it's just spectacular !!!"
4,1.5,Already feels like a genre flick. Probably because it is.

4,5.0,"This season moves, so many great moments. The best season of the series!"
4,5.0,The craft is mastered in the fourth season and with tense plot points and and a ever changing and evolving evil.
4,5.0,Game of Thrones Season 4 | Detailed note: 9.9
4,0.5,Most overrated show of all time I was waiting for some character or even just some welly filmed action but never got either in all of these seasons
4,5.0,"a complete masterpiece, it may be weird to say, but i personally prefer this season over Lord of the rings!"
4,5.0,what the hell 4 seasons in a row ?
4,5.0,"Even if u hated the ending this is by far the greatest show of all time. Each episode keeps u on the edge of your seat. Never have i ever heard as many people talk about whats gunna happen next week. There was just a lot of people upset because they didn't get what they want but that is what the whole show was, you never got what u want."
4,5.0,game of thrones is a show like none other it has drama fantasy a fiew funny moments especillt from tyrion and an amazing action set pieces not to mention a spectacle of visuals thanks to its production value that is often rare among other tv show. although some would say that the depiction of violence and sexual content is exessive personnally no show has ever made use of the mature content like game of thrones has but the real aspect of the greatness of this show lies in its intricate writing and story-telling so overall game of thrones in my oppinion is the greatest show ever made. P.S the final episodes of the final season are enjoyable but dissappointing
4,5.0,wow!!i cant believe what a great season it was.each and every episode was literally shocking and thrilled!
4,5.0,"Here it is, without a doubt the best season of GoT! Exemplary! The very best of the series's constant seasonal masterpieces. 10/10"
4,5.0,"Amazing. This season is full of dread, which is very fitting as last season they lost the war, Robb and Catelyn were killed, Arya is scarred from witnessing basically all of her family get killed (Ned, Robb, Catelyn). Theon is captured. Sansa is fearful for her life as she now believes that all of her family is dead. Dany is showing signs of her going mad. And then the season starts with the death of Joffrey (WHAT?!?!?!?!?). Cersei is heartbroken and full of rage, Tyrion snaps and gets sick of everyone's shit, Jaime goes through a dark turn, Brienne goes through a lot. Jon goes through a lot. This season is very great and brings some of the best character endings in the show (Joffrey, Tywin, Shae, Ygritte).Also that ending fight with Brienne and the Hound was amazing and then Arya leaving him to die is a turning point for her character but also is the cherry on top for the season."
4,5.0,By far the best season in the show. This season is really what made Game of Thrones the gem it is today!
4,5.0,Best season of GOT. Just perfect.
4,5.0,"best, it was really good, i enjoyed it. please give us no2 etc asap. as I WANT MORE !!!!"
4,5.0,"The show kept going in the right direction, once again the political intrigue kept me fascinated"
4,4.0,The series don't start to suffer the continue losses of characters. The develop of the living ones is outstanding.
4,5.0,Arguably the best written season of the show featuring an amazing battle sequence along with political prowess at the show's finest.
4,4.0,"The last ""good"" season of Game of Thrones. This was when the source material was beginning to run out, and yet the series still maintained its quality. Such a shame this did not continue."
4,5.0,Arguably the last great/amazing season of the show. If you can dont watch the rest of the seasons.
4,4.5,"Loved every aspect of the season with very few exception, as with any show or movie. Made me look forward to the next season!"
4,5.0,An astonishing and beautiful season that progresses the story along with keeping the characters true to what they are.
4,5.0,"This is it. This is the best season of Game of Thrones. Especially after I took it upon myself to edit out that non-canon rape scene in adobe premiere (episode three). It feels like they have brought a few stories to a close, but it's really just a pause for breath. This season is the most consistent."
4,4.0,"Great season, great everything until the sand snakes."
4,5.0,"After a very heartbreaking third season, Game of Thrones follows up with yet another amazing season with moment after moment of shocking, engaging drama. (A+)"
4,0.5,"The story of game of thrones is fake, wrong and family destroying. full of sad scenes like rape, killing innocent people, adult parts. all the people slept together.!!! Too bad"
4,5.0,Hands down best show on 📺
4,4.5,A cool season however writing started to slip.
4,2.0,The writing began to go downhill during season 4.
4,5.0,"GoT continues to ride high as chaos continues to have its way with the Seven Kingdoms. Meticulous storytelling, great acting, fantastic soundtrack."
4,5.0,THE BEST SEASON. Season 4 was amazing. Every episode kept you hooked and it was perfectly done.
4,5.0,Just keeps getting better and more nail biting as we watch the characters grow and the threat grows larger.
4,4.0,montaña es tan brutal la muerte son increíbles sobre todo la muerte que hace montaña
4,5.0,"Unneccessary deviations from the book, which sucks for people like me who respect the original work of the author. If the book does nothing wrong and can be adapted easily into TV then there's no need to make weird changes to the story. Otherwise another fantastic season of this brilliant show."
4,4.5,"Whereas this season starts off very strong, it starts to drag (in my opinion) towards later in the season and starts to show a little bit of the problems which would plague later seasons. Definitely a better fantasy adaptation than a lot of films/tv series I have seen, but no where near the comfort of season 1 or the shock of season 3."
4,5.0,"Very happy with the entire season, except how they left out a huge plot point in the final episode, one that was building up since season 1. Oh well, it was still amazing."
4,4.0,"This show has its several flaws, but all four of these stars are earned just for the Battle of Castle Black, which is on par with Helm's Deep in my book."
4,5.0,Outstanding season! This was Thrones at it's best.
4,5.0,"A lot of people consider Season 3 as the climax of this show, but I have to pick Season 4 as the best. The Battle at the Wall, Tyrion's Confession, and countless other plot points just made this so great for me. This was the best point in Jon's arc for me, and I loved every moment of it. Was certainly the most memorable Season for me. I'm giving it a 5 stars, even though I know there are some flaws such as Tyrion's final act, and Jaime not revealing to Tyrion who Tysha really was."
4,5.0,"Again, this season just proves that this show is one of the best out there. I feel like as each season progresses, the character development and action just keeps getting better."
4,5.0,"The absolute best season of game of thrones, the fast paced episodes the shocking twists and turns will satisfy fans and the action is at a high right now with delivering for the most part other than the battle on the wall, season four expands and closes character arcs without losing any steam at all, simply perfection!"
4,5.0,Wonderful. Season 4 is rightly much loved. Its finale continues to be a favorite of mine of the whole show.
4,5.0,"Season four of Game of Thrones constantly subverts our expectations and continues to be as bloody as ever. It's ending, however, shifts the plot in shocking ways and contains one of the best fight scenes thus far."
4,5.0,"Game of Thrones just keeps getting better and better and this season was even better than the first three seasons and it is still my 2nd favorite show of all time. Peter Dinklage, Maisie Williams, Emilia Clarke, Kit Harington, Sophie Turner, Rory McCann, Gwendoline Christie, Aidan Gillen, Nikolaj Coster-Waldau, Lena Headey, Alfie Allen, Iwan Rheon, and John Bradley gave outstanding leading performances and the supporting performances from Daniel Portman, Hannah Murray, Pedro Pascal, Diana Rigg, Charles Dance, Conleth Hill, Jerome Flynn, Rose Leslie, Michiel Huisman, Kerry Ingram, Jack Gleeson, and Natalie Dormer were terrific. The fighting and battle scenes were excellent and really awesome especially the battle between the Night's Watch and the Wildlings, the fight between Brienne and The Hound, and the fight between Oberyn and Gregor. The writing and storytelling continues to be great. The visual effects were spectacular especially the skeleton Wights, the dragons (specifically Drogon), and Drogon's fire. The makeup effects were very impressive especially the Night King, the White Walker, and the Giants. The costumes were fantastic especially all of Emilia Clarke's outfits, Gwendoline Christie's outfits, Nikolaj Coster-Waldau's outfits, Lena Headey's outfits, and Sophie Turner's outfits. The score and all of the music in this season was great. Also the final scene was great it was so cool to Arya finally safe and getting somewhere new. Season 4 of Game of Thrones is another A+ season."
4,5.0,The last good season
4,4.0,"This season was just as good as the 1st season you get to see a personal side of Jamie which I liked. Gotta love the Hound. You can tell in this 4th season tables are starting to turn, some good some bad. A great cliffhanger."
4,5.0,"Best season of the show. Action, writing, soundtrack, and acting are fantastic."
4,5.0,Brutal and shocking. Everything you expect from GOT
4,5.0,"Best season of the series! Shocking yet amazing at the same time, this season is one of the best things to reach a TV."
4,5.0,"After watching all the way to the end, I have to say, this one was my favorite in all seasons. Story line was superb, amazing acting, incredible sets. So powerful."
4,5.0,Game of Thrones season 5 is entertaining and unpredictable as characters have some of their best moments in the show.
4,5.0,"The best season for GoT, and for any tv show ever made."
4,4.0,Joffrey's death was everything.
4,4.5,Another great season!
4,5.0,"Finally a show without those stupid Hollywoodish, PG-13 happy endings. Something serious."
4,5.0,"Probably the best season so far this epic TV series. The season was full of shocking developments, immaculate action sequences and the best writing of any show possibly ever. Such major events as the Red Wedding, Jamai return homing after losing his sword hand, the Battle at the Wall, Joffrey finally dying, etc etc etc. Each episode of he 10 was amazing full of suspense and mystery. Not a single episode fell below 4.5*. I'm very much looking forward to season 5."
4,5.0,"family drama with the Lannisters to say the least. arya scratches a name off her list, but not in the way you'd think."
4,5.0,Best show on TV. top 3 best show of all time
4,5.0,"An intricate, big-budget combination of rich set pieces, superb characters, and larger-than-life stories (not to mention a handful of surprises), Game of Thrones is at its all-time best in season four."
4,5.0,The books where amazing and the show is extremely engaging!
4,5.0,"While somewhat slow at some points, Season 4 totally makes up to it by linking characters together that we've grown to love separately to a point that if feels like crossover episodes."
4,5.0,Game of thrones season 4 sees the show continuing to remain one of televisions most vital drama series.
4,5.0,"Story, Cast, Acting, VFX etc every is Tremendous also Most Realistically Written Series, Realism means nothing blurred or muted or cut e.g. Sex Scenes & violence Scenes which makes it different from other TV series & Amazing & Realistic... Also High Fantasy, Kings, Queen, Wars, White Walker (Snow Monsters) & Dragons Makes it Great High fantasy TV Series... To the point & Close to the Book, This TV series is Magnificent & Excellent, I Really Liked it Rated 10/10 Regards"
4,5.0,"A huge step forward for GoT! Season four is totally -with no dout- amazing and perfectly made! Loved every single episode of it! Everything was just perfect, even the soundtrack was very awesome! They really got attention for every detail. They didn't make any mistake, literately! I didn't feel any boredom in this season, not even once! The CGI was more even better than the three previous seasons! And episode 9 was totally freaking out!! The direction, soundtrack,performances and the CGI, made it the best episode in this entire series! Season 4 is definitely great, with memorable moments and great soundtrack and CGI!"
4,5.0,"Game of Thrones keeps getting better in an ultra-focused fourth season that boasts a less convoluted narrative without sacrificing the show's trademark blend of top tier character development, mind-blowing twists, and spectacular set pieces."
4,5.0,The best TV series of all time.
4,5.0,Valar Morguilis.. All Men Must Die.. And as they say.. they die eventually.. The one who sits over it.. Dies.. Sad but exciting.. Amazing..
4,5.0,my all time favorite TV season
4,4.5,New alliances are formed and characters have changed and developed so much so that they are unrecognizable to their characters from the first couple of seasons. This story ends at a cliffhanger and leaves you wanting more. With characters being brought back and adding more depth to the story.
4,5.0,"Once again, just like the previous seasons, it really is just some great TV. The Hound vs. Brienne was awesome."
4,4.5,Puntaje Original: 9.0 Simplemente épica.
4,5.0,"Peter Dinklage owned this entire season, hands down! He made me laugh, he made me cry, he made me cringe. #TeamTyrion"
4,5.0,"Game of Thrones una de las mejores series jamás creadas, a estas alturas los personajes son tan buenos como cualquier heroe icónicos de la cultura popular. Nadie está a salvo en la serie y eso la hace única."
4,3.5,Wow I cant believe Rains of Castamere is the only song ever written
4,4.0,Game of Thrones: Season 4 Game of Thrones takes another glorious leap with one little step backward
4,5.0,Definitely the best season of Game of Thrones.
4,4.5,The best show on television continued that trend. They intertwine the existing cast of characters we love with well layered new ones.
4,5.0,"Climatic end as Winter draws nearer The season 4 finale of HBOs hit series and global phenomenon, Game Of Thrones, aired on Sunday night in the US, and it left the eagerly watching audience with a plethora of questions that are eating up every viewer. What will become of Kings Landing? Where are Tyrion and Varys heading for? Will a Cersie and Jaimes relationship happen? Will Ayra ever be reunited with her family? The Jon Snow and Stannis situation? How long until Daenerys makes her move, and what has become of Drogon? And perhaps the most important one, what will happen because of Brans successful journey to The Children? Plus, there are so many other unanswered questions concerning each of these characters roles next season: Bealish, The Tyrells, Theon, Brienne, Sansa, Jorah, The Mountain, Lord Bolton and so many other characters that have been perfectly woven into the story, and whose importance is yet to be determined. The scene which for myself and perhaps a great deal many of Game Of Thrones fans that is my favourite of the season and perhaps the programme in its entirety, is the final scene in episode 6, The Laws of Gods and Men, when Tyrions passionate and angry speech leads to his trial being decided by combat. His defence which was so brilliantly acted by Peter Dinklage, gave me goosebumps and left me in shock and open mouthed. That is my highlight of the season! The Children episode, the finale, was absolutely spot on with every scene, there didnt seem to be any dialogue or unnecessary action wasted for the sake of it. Every line and word was meaningful and well-thought out. The thing that has intrigued me the most and will be eating me up inside until season 5, is what will happen with Bran, the children of the forest and the 3-eyed-raven. There was one line that was brilliant and perfect cliff-hanger material. Youll never walk again. But you will fly!- 3-eyed-raven. Will the heart tree that Bran has journeyed towards play a big part in season 5? Will Bran be able to have the sight of not just his direwolf and Hodor, but also other animals and birds, maybe even a Dragon? Are the old Gods of the North real? Who are The Children of the Forest? Who is the 3-eyed-raven? I feel Bran will have a crucial part to play in the coming season and probably every one after. Lets hope the conclusion lives up the suspense that has been created. Im yet to read the books by G.R.R. Martin, and now with about a year to wait for season 5 to arrive, I am now contemplating whether or not to satisfy my desire to know what happens next in the books or not. I have read books such as Harry Potter, The Hunger Games, Da Vinci Code and Atonement before they were produced into films, so by the time I watched them I didnt experience the unpredictable nature and not knowing what happens next which I am experiencing now with Game Of Thrones Perhaps Ive already made the decision to not read the books right now, and to enjoy the wait and the ride that the HBO series offers. Heres to the next season, may it be as suspenseful, brilliant and as brutal as season 4 has been! All men must die! https://rwh92.wordpress.com/"
4,5.0,"Game of Thrones continues to be one of the best shows on TV, combining meticulously-plotted character arcs while earning its twists."
4,5.0,Best season of a tv-show i've ever seen. Brilliant.
4,4.0,"The best series yet, as events start to get more exciting and the characters become more intertwined"
4,5.0,<@ if (review) { @><@= review @><@ } @>
4,5.0,"Breathing a word of what happens in Game of Thrones' masterfully paced, incredibly suspenseful, terribly intense fourth season feels like it would ruin all the fun, all the nail biting, all the uncomfortable shifts in your seat, all the raised hair on your neck and arms, all the chills racing up your back, all the laughs that burst out of your gut, all the cheers, the tears and gasps. So no spoiler warnings necessary. What I will say, though, is that Benioff, Weiss and the rest of the cast and crew are at the top of their collective game. The writing? Somehow sharper, smarter and more engrossing than before. The pacing and plotting, the finest the series has offered. The performances, outstanding; across the board. The casting, dead on. The changes to the source novels, clever and judicious. I'd argue most of the alterations that are made improve upon the books, but that's a whole other debate. The locations and production design, beautiful and evocative. The visual effects, better than ever and highly effective. The music, stirring and hypnotic. And the finale? One of the most powerful season finales of the show thus far, and one that will leave you begging for season five."
4,5.0,the best thing ive ever seen.... ^_^
4,5.0,A must watch for everyone
4,5.0,one of the best seasons we see for the first time the white walkers
4,5.0,"No surprise that the adaptation of the best book in the ASoIaF series (A Storm of Swords - which got double the time for character/plot developtment by being split into seasons 3 & 4) also made for the best season of the show (so far) and one of the best TV seasons of all time, possibly surpassed only by one of the final seasons of Breaking Bad. And Maisie Williams as Arya Stark deserved an Emmy for best supporting actress for seasons 3 & 4 because even at a young age she her performance is exceptional and outshines all the other characters on a show filled with amazing actors."
4,4.5,"Puntaje Original: 9.0 Sin lugar a dudas, Game of Thrones es la p*ta mejor serie de todos los tiempos."
4,0.5,Still as dumb and boring as the first 3.
4,5.0,OMG.. BEST SEASON I HAVE EVER SEEN ON ANY SHOW EVER.
4,4.0,"In for the long haul. Season four gives us ten consistently good episodes and ends with a promise of more Maisie Williams. DVD/BRD extra feature ""The Fallen"" is well worth our time; I will miss Rose Leslie and her Ygritte."
4,5.0,"Great story, great visuals, great acting, characters, pretty much everything is great in this show and continues to be the greatest thing television has to offer,"
4,5.0,"It's the same old story I've been saying, but the fourth season of ""Game of Thrones"" truly does find even MORE ways to be better than its preceding season. This set of 10 episodes is the most consistently gripping and well-plotted piece of creative storytelling I've ever seen on television."
4,4.5,"The series takes another sensational turn with season 4 and it shows off its true capabilities in terms of the real scale it entails. In essence, this series is what every single fantasy fan can dream of and a little more. Although it is a shame we give way to more major characters, some just a for a short sabbatical whilst others are a little more permanent. Not my favourite season but it's still brilliant to watch."
4,5.0,"Best season so far, intrigued of what will happen next ."
4,5.0,"With even more hard hitting drama, development, excitement, surprises, and beautiful visuals, season 4 valiantly continues Game of Thrones' epic saga"
4,5.0,One of the greatest tv series of all time
4,4.5,"I dont know how the showrunners continue to keep the show so awesome. Granted, having fantastic source material helps, but movies and film are certainly capable of turning great source material into humdrum adaptations. Not so here; everything is intriguing and fresh. With many characters now deceased, new characters begin to emerge in more prominent roles. This season, we see expanded stories from Arya, Sansa, the Hound, Ramsay Snow, and fresh face Oberyn Martell. We begin to see the humanization of some of our more villainous characters, such as Cersei and Jaime. Another great season from Benioff and Weiss. Lets keep it going, guys!"
4,4.5,"Differences going on, some for good, some for nah, the Viper nailed it!"
4,5.0,"Full of unforgettable moments(including some gruesome unforgettable deaths), GoT has clearly become an all-time best."
4,5.0,Season 4 of Game of Thrones continues the show's winning streak with outstanding performances and more unexpected plot twists.
4,5.0,"The one season that showed us how the good guys still could triumph at times. This season provided all the things one has come to love about the show, and it delivers like never before. The purple wedding! The assault on Craster's Keep! The Courtroom Trial! Oberyn! The Mountain and the Viper's duel! To top it all off, it also had the 2 ebst last 2 episodes of all the seasons. Few will forget a certain epic battle at Castle Black as well as the revenge of everyone's beloved half-man. Valar Morghulis!"
4,5.0,This is the best season of Game of Thrones so far.
4,4.5,"An outstanding cast, a great drama, great action scenes and intensity- especially the last couple episodes, especially the Purple Wedding.."
4,5.0,The greatest season of Game of Thrones.
4,5.0,"Challenges season 3 as the best one yet. Impeccable performances all around. The Oberyn Martell storyline was excellent for introducing a vicious yet likable and honorable character, and the snow walker plot was not overdone nor under-screened."
4,4.0,"This is what Game of Thrones should be like; action-packed and full of nuanced storytelling. This is by far the best season of Game of Thrones to date. The show continues with even more unexpected events and unpredictable storytelling. There're actually no episodes that I would consider as boring or less impressive, which is a great improvement since season one and two. The golden aspect of GoT is the characters, it's the major thing that makes the show so great. There're much more going on with the characters in this fourth season, they interact with other characters we already know but who comes from the other part of the world. There's no question that this is a great show, and the much higher amount of action is the greatest thing. The dialogs have become much more entertaining due to change of content. The previous great aspects like unpredictability, great music, unique cinematography, realism and flawless characters are still constant. But the story has developed at a much greater and action-packed way even though we still have much build-ups. It's therefor really a great season, and the story keeps going, so there's still much to tell. The best thing with this season is that the characters we all know but who never have met face to face meet each other. That's so touching! It's an almost flawless continuation with great characters and actors; especially the newcomer Kristofer Hivju! But it still do suffer with slowness and lack of long-term action. But the action that do exist in this season is awesome! To keep it short; this is what Game of Thrones should be like, not slow and boring like the first two seasons. My overall rating for each episode is 7.5, and because it really is so much better than season three, and due to I really enjoyed it, am I giving this fourth season of Game of Thrones an 8/10. 8/10"
4,5.0,"With some of the best writing seen on TV these days, Game of Thrones returns and gets its best season yet, with great pace and incredible perfomances from Peter Dinklage, Charles Dance and Nikolaj Coster-Waldau, among others."
4,4.5,"Season 4 was packed with actions and plot twists, the Black Castle battle was great, not to mention the Purple Wedding."
4,4.5,"Season 4 delivers more twists, deaths, and action than any season yet and has the production value to compete with Hollywood films."
4,5.0,Probably the best season of the series to date.
4,5.0,Great show. The only season I wasn't totally happy with was Season 2 - mainly because so many new characters and hard to follow at first but I generally watched episodes 2x and it all came together. I'm not usually a fan of violent shows so giving it mainly 5stars is huge for me. I like the idea that is is the first of its kind to have really powerful female leads. I know lots of women that love this show.
4,5.0,"The greatest season yet, every episode is a game changer."
4,5.0,"Shocking, bloodthirsty and thrilling with an all-star cast and beautifully complex characters. Nothing is black and white in Game of Thrones."
4,5.0,"There you go, Game of Thrones, I knew you'd get there. Season 4 was spectacular. Most of my love for this season came towards the end in episode 8, when The Red Viper fought The Mountain. That scene made my jaw drop. I couldn't believe it. But the season was more than just that one scene; the fighting and war was better and occurred more often, you started to really care about characters, shocks everywhere. I'm fully on board now with GoT. I also hope the Hound didn't die when left on the mountain, because I'm hoping to see him fight his brother to the death, especially after The Mountain killed Red Viper. I never read the books, so don't tell me if he did die or not please. But what an incredible season this fourth one was."
4,4.5,"""Season 4"" is the best season so far. It has the most mystery and intrigue out of all four seasons, along with incredible action and non-stop excitement."
4,5.0,Game of Thrones world is so heavy it leaves the world unbalanced.
4,5.0,This proves that we in the Golden Age of TV
4,3.5,If they'd have more scenes relevant to the story and less scenes for 'shock factor' It would be worth a higher rating from me. But to each his own.
4,5.0,"AHHHHHHH! I WANT SEASON 5 RIGHT NOW!!! ARYA STARK WAS AMAZING, AND SO WAS TYRION!! :D"
4,4.0,"For the fourth year running, episode nine was the best of the season. Oh, also the show's good."
4,5.0,"100% Can´t stop watching it. Game of thrones is a pure drug. Exciting in every way. Season 4 is better than all it´s previous seasons in every single way. I´m more than ready for season 5. And if you haven´t seen Game of thrones, I´m not sure what are you waiting for. 5 stars out of 5 stars."
4,3.5,Finally jumped on the Game of Thrones Train. I have to say I almost stopped watching after the 1st season. Was def overrated(Spartacus and Rome had way better 1st seasons in my opinion) but the 2nd season got better for sure and the 3rd season is my fav so far.
4,4.5,Stannis is the rightful King !
4,5.0,"To be frank, I consider this to be the best show currently on television. With it's diverse and complicated plot, you'll either give up quickly or become absolutely enthralled in this violent, detailed, and incredible world. While the beginning of season 4 moves a little slowly, it's always worth it. Season 4 is not a let down in any way."
4,4.0,So far so good while the middle ground left you in a suspense that felt a bit heavy and draggy the last 3 episodes bring it home and up the anti for next season. Putting GOT in a good position for the 5th season which should prove to be a challenge as these next couple books are two of the least favorited.
4,5.0,"Loved every single episode of the 4 seasons. One word, AMAZING. Everybody, this is a MUST WATCH!"
4,5.0,The best season of GOT yet.
4,5.0,"In a word: Epic. A masterpiece of story telling, production and acting....intelligent, educational and amusing...."
4,5.0,"With a cast of strong actors with so much potential, and a plot so intricated and complicated like the 'A Song of Ice and Fire', this show shapes up to be everybody's favorite. Not to say it has literally everything you could ask for in a tv show. Well done HBO, can't wait for season 5!"
4,5.0,"The only reason you could possibly dislike Game of Thrones is if you like hating popular things. Game of Thrones is by far the best television show ever produced. The writing is superb (thanks in great part to George R. R. Martin), the acting is sublime, the filmography is top-notch work, and just about every other element of the masterpiece that is Game of Thrones has been refined. I have yet to watch an episode that disappointed me. You receive just enough from each character to love them all, and worry constantly about their survival. The day GoT ends if the day I will question if Hollywood or television will ever be able to pull off what they have done here. If you haven't seen this series or read the book, keep in mind you are missing an absolutely essential human experience."
4,5.0,The best season ever ! Thrill for the episode 9.
4,5.0,"lets put it this way, i watched 40 episodes in about 168 hours. Cant wait for Winter."
4,5.0,"Outstanding performances, plot twists, drama, and visually appealing."
4,5.0,Best season so far. They are getting better and better at making this show. Can't wait until april... I heard there were some badass characters around the corner
4,5.0,My favorite series on tv it just keeps getting better and better.
4,5.0,"I have always been your son. The Stark family remains separated and their family seems to get smaller and smaller. The Lannisters continue to hold the crown, but an event early this season threatens to divide the family. An army of wildlings are approaching the north wall and the night watch are completely unprepared and fail to heed Jon Snows warning. Meanwhile, Daenaryen Targaryen learns there is more to ruling than conquering. The Mountain and The Viper. The storyline for this season is absolutely brilliant and definitely picked up the pace and ends very dramatically. I loved the evolution of the characters outside of maybe Deanaryen. The action scenes were awesome and the acting was breathtaking. HBO did a great job of keeping the cast relatively together (outside of Daenaryens boy toy being replaced with a new actor). Going at it alone, you wont last longer than a day out there. Ill last longer than you. I strongly feel this is the greatest television series of all time. I have never been so emotionally tied to characters and this is so brilliantly written. There are continuous hints throughout the season of what is about to comeand you still never see it coming. The greatest television episode ever was on this season, and the ending is predictable, painfully predictableand youre left open jawed when it happens. I so, so, so strongly recommend this show. I am guilty of being a dwarf. Grade: A+"
4,5.0,"best TV show ever, love the dialogs and charaters ."
4,4.5,"Weird scenes, awesome scenes and tits. Yeah!"
4,4.0,The story grows more dark and compelling as the series continues to expand in Game of Thrones Season 4. Vibrant action and riveting portrayals only carries the series' reputation as the best on television. 4/5
4,0.5,"More tits isn't a staple of this show. Its one of its defining features, and that's why this season is one of its worst, and put me off watching it for its continued run. I have read all the books of A Song Of Fire And Ice, and found something amazing in all of them. They have flaws granted, but they are rather brilliant in their own style and character based storytelling. The TV show does not live up to that expectation. It has subtle glances at it, it even uses the same Lore and devices George RR Martin uses. But it fails because it doesn't have the backbone or courage to truly create something original and ground breaking. Why isnt it the best show on TV. One simple word. Rape. In every season, its been implied, talked about, laughed about, threatened and worst of all shown. In Episode 7 of the fourth series I was horrified and disgusted to watch what was in Martins books a mere mention that the brothers of the nights watch who rid Craster's Keep, rape Craster's inbred daughters. They filmed explicit scenes of big white men raping women. Isn't that normal? Isn't that just Game Of Thrones? No. It really isn't. But it is completely in the doing of HBO and the writers of Game Of Thrones. I have nothing but disgust and hatred for everyone who allowed a scene like that to be filmed and aired. No matter how much i loved Pedro Pascal as my favourite character form the books Oberyn Martell. No matter how much i loved seeing Brienne beat the Mountain at his own game. No matter how much i loved seeing the actors and characters grow. It doesn't change the fact that David Benioff and D.B Weiss are ok with putting their names to a program which shows explicit material like rape. Sorry mainstream TV watchers and people of the world. Rape is not ok. And moving forward in our world and teaching children how you should treat other people, Game Of Thrones isn't even ok as a guilty pleasure for when your a teen."
4,5.0,A brilliant portrayal of my favorite Fantasy book series (I haven't read Lord Of The Rings) it is a fantastic tv show and a great serial
4,5.0,"I don't even know if it's worth reviewing.. Game of Thrones is the 'King of TV shows' and should keep the throne until the finale (here's to hoping the writer eventually finishes the books) The story does divert a bit from the book, but in general they stay the course and it is a must must must watch!"
4,4.0,"A slight dip in quality taints the latter half of this season. It suffered a sloppy execution and relied heavily on dues ex machina. Filler is starting to creep into the episodes along with what some people would consider stalling for the nex arc or the end credits. I am concerned for this shows future if it keeps it up . It is still a very good show,just a little more rushed and sloppy."
4,5.0,"Starts off great and never ceases to shock and astonish. Game of Thrones Season Four finally lets the good guys have their shot. The story is once again very well-adapted from the novel series by George R.R Martin. We get to know the characters better and even come to admire characters (one way or another) that we once hated. Kudos to the Emmy-worthy performances of Peter Dinklage (Tyrion Lannister) and Lena Headey (Cersei Lannister) who carried this season almost single-handed. Among the best moments in the show were the ending of Episode 2, the ending of Episode 8, and the entirety of Episode 9 which were all well-done. In conclusion this season continued the streak of delivering an overall memorable show that will surely go down in history as one of the greatest television series' of all time."
4,4.5,Is it strange that I would want to listen to Tyrion Lannister talk about the pressing need to know why his cousin had such an fascination with beetle crushing any time of the day? This season was amazing in many regards. Horrifying in several well played points - and maybe not so very true to the books. I still favour Season 2 for its more well-played out script banter but this one took it for big game changing moments. Come at me season 5! Cannot wait!
4,5.0,Season 4 might be the best yet from Game of Thrones and proves that having no main character can make you fear for everyone and create some truly gripping drama.
4,5.0,"The least boring season so far. So.. much.. going.. on! Favorite Episodes: 2, 8, 9, 10."
4,5.0,Amazing like the books
4,5.0,"While it may deviate from the books a little, it doesn't lose its richness, nor the intertwining storylines."
4,5.0,"Another Must see show, I hope the author starts taking things more serious and finishes the book series, so he dosnt hold up this awesome adaptation."
4,5.0,"Like I even need to mention how much love Game of Thrones has across the world right now. The HBO series has become a phenomenon that will almost certainly be remembered as a classic in film and television. This is one of those rare shows where the level of quality is equal to that of a $200 million movie. It's even got more depth than most fantasy movies recently because it takes the most risk and HBO is among the most ambitious television networks on the planet. If you haven't watched an episode of Game of Thrones yet do yourself a favour and watch the first episode of the series. If you don't like that one watch the second and/or third one right after and see if you like it. If not, well I've said all I can about this masterpiece. Hodor! ""5/5 stars."""
4,5.0,LOTR's opponent... MASTERPIECE
4,5.0,The last five episodes once again reminded me just to keep the faith. The start of the season might be a bit bumpy but by the end = mind blown + awesome bits in books covered spectacularly!
4,4.0,"Although one of the stories is suprisingly weak and a few characters' writing is questionable, Season 4 presents an easier to follow story, that is still among the finest on TV."
4,5.0,"Nothing short of a masterpiece. An engaging political drama as well as an action packed fantasy epic, it appeals to every viewer in its own way (assuming they can stomach the content). Although one might occasionally wonder if the plot will ever move, a quick season 8 game changer will dispel all notions of momentum loss. Is it gory? Yes. Is it complicated? Very. Is it the best show on television? If you think otherwise, you obviously haven't been paying attention."
4,4.5,"Temporada casi perfecta, hasta el fatídico capítulo final. Quizás más terrible para los lectores, que para los que siguen solamente la serie, pero igualmente decepcionante (ese capítulo)."
4,5.0,"Half the brilliance in the Game of Thrones series is its continual jaw dropping unpredictability, constantly reminding us that nobody is safe, every chance it gets. This is about as intelligent, exciting, provocative, epic in scope, and well crafted as any massive full scaled fantasy series has gotten in both TV, and film."
4,4.5,"Darker and more unpredictable than ever, Game of Thrones continues to be a strong offering for TV fans."
4,5.0,"Definitely one of the best TV series ever, Season 4 will take you through an insane roller coaster of emotions. So satisfying you'd asked for seconds, or rather, fifths."
4,2.0,"Apparently the showrunners are going to continue to bounce back and forth between staying almost completely true to the books to changing a bunch of crap for no reason. This one's not as disappointing as season 2 and I was surprised to see that the 1, 6, 8, and 9 were done really well, but the final episode of this season is a joke to anyone who read the book. I don't know what the hell they were thinking."
4,5.0,Fantastic show. Probably the best on TV right now.
4,5.0,you havent lived unless you have watched game of thrones
4,5.0,JOFFREY'S DEAD! NOW WHO WILL I HATE! I think the reason why I am giving each season such a high score; its because the positives outweigh the minor negatives which is AWESOME.
4,4.0,La mejor temporada de GOT hasta el momento. Hasta me están dando ganas de leerme los libros.
4,5.0,"Right from the shocking whodunit twist of the purple wedding to the scintillating game changer finale, season 4 has been the most meticulously plotted and richly realised of the show yet."
4,5.0,Peter Dinklage is the best part of this show
4,4.5,Things turned out quite well for the children in GOT. Just one question though: WHERE THE FCK IS GENDRY??? Still rowing a boat.
4,5.0,EVERY. THING. IS. AWESOME.
4,5.0,best tv show ever !!
4,5.0,"Truly mind-blowing. Well it's indeed ""all men must die"", i'll be waiting for another great dying scenes since there's still a lot of alive characters (in addition, few of the new ones too!) Incredible job at making the script!"
4,5.0,"Game Of Thrones is fantastic series with high quality actors, excellent effects, intelligent dialogue and an involved and exciting storyline. Although the series could have been hampered by Martin's less then spectacular writing, the show's creators gloss over the sour points well, creating a thrilling spectacle that is easily competing for the best show on television with each new season."
4,5.0,Best TV show of all time! A cinema spectacular fit for the big screen! All the bad guys die too! Except for Episode 9 this was the best Season so far. Although Season 3 was also awesome.
4,5.0,"More drama ,action, deeper character studies and yet giving hope for much better future episodes, season 4 has been the best addition for GOT yet!"
4,4.5,"While it was a great season of the show and I enjoyed some changes, it didn't exactly live up to my expectations as an adaptation of the second half of A Storm of Swords, which is by far the best of the ASOIAF novels. That being said, there are many parts that are completely brilliant and rarely is it ever subpar . 8.5-9.0/10"
4,3.5,"Season 4 should probably be considered as transitory, since it was not as compelling and paced as season 3. Also, the writer's trend to focus much longer on the individual characters for me has a litlle blemished the ""game"" factor. Still good, but not as good as last year."
4,0.5,truly one of the biggest pieces of junk placed on television in years. I put this up there with Alf.
4,4.0,"I just started watching this show this year and if you ask me which season is my favorite, it would be the first season. The first season has made me love the characters from the very first episode (except Joffrey of course). The second season was forgettable (except the final two episode of that season) but not terrible. The third season did better but I still prefer the first season. And in this case of season four, I still do. Since the fourth season is the second part of the third book of A Song of Ice and Fire series, I think the writers had a bit of a difficult time splitting the third book into half in terms of story timing. But, they made this flaw up by putting every shocking or memorable moment at almost every episode Episode 1: Arya was badass with The Hound. Memorable. Episode 2: King Joffrey dead. Shocking. Episode 3: Daenerys launches broken slave chains into a city full of slaves. Memorable. Episode 4: THE WHITE WALKERS. SHOCKING! Episode 6: Peter Dinklage giving out his winning Emmy speech. Oops, sorry, I meant, Tyrion unleashes his inner anger by demanding trial by combat. Memorable. Episode 7: Littlefinger pushes Lysa. Memorable Episode 8: dont make me describe what happened in the end of this episode. But **** shocking! Episode 9: Well, the episode is entirely memorable with its epic battle scenes. The plot of the whole series cannot move itself. It had to rely on character development and it has to be good, and of course, its brilliant. This is why this is my favorite show. In order to love a show, I must love the characters, not just like them. Tryion and Sansa had the most interesting and the best character development this season. First for Tyrion. He is becoming the mixture of why I loved him now and the Tryion we first knew. While for Sansa, she became from an innocent , naive girl to a much braver, confident woman. I am interested how she plays out next season. However, two characters did not have a significant character development this season. Theon still becomes Reek. Bran still eyerolls. Come on writers, make them actually interesting next season! The graphics are of course good, but thats not why people like this show. In terms of the final episode this season, it did tie some loose-ends set up in the previous season and this season, but it did not have the season finale vibe for me. It was anti-climatic. But hey! At least they did not add Khalessi at the end of the finale! The writers said that this episode was their finest hour yet. Well, I disagree. If they added this erm, ""Lady Stoneheart"", then it would have been their finest hour. When I read what "":ady Stoneheart"" meant, this should have been in the finale and I think it could have been a badass moment of the show. I am crossing my fingers that this would be in the next season. Overall, while I still consider season one to be their best, season fours obvious highlight is some good character development. And I cant wait for season four. Well, maybe I can, but, you know what I mean."
4,5.0,Så bliver det ikke bedre!
4,5.0,"another solid entry and was the last great season of the show. Season three was the best, but this is not far behind."
4,5.0,"Again, It was out there with the best. Its getting better and better. A Must was Season,"
4,4.5,The Most brilliant and action packed of all GOT seasons. A must see for fans of the show and books!!!!
4,5.0,"Tyrion, John Snow, and Arya are the top highlights of this season by far. This season knocks out the first and third season right out of the water, Because this season is just fantastic with a brilliant cast and characters and excellent acting from the cast."
4,5.0,"Season 3 of Game of Thrones ended with a crushing blow, whereas season 4 gives plenty of satisfaction with some well deserved vengeance. We don't even have to wait long because right in episode 2 the loathsome Joffrey finally meets a delightfully grotesque and painful end, and more follow as the season progresses. Eventually Mance Raydar's wildling army attacks the wall and we are given the best battle ever put to the television screen even knocking Season 2's Blackwater out of the sky. Season 4 of Game of Thrones had a faster pace, more action, and more of everything else that makes the series great, and I would say it is the best season yet."
4,4.5,"Anything lower than 5/5 would be inappropriate for a show as well executed as Game of Thrones. In a way, this season was the best yet, but, as a reader, I do not find it quite perfect. The reason for that weren't the radical changes from the books, but the fact that the overambitious script resulted in slight incoherence."
4,5.0,"amazing... just amazing. The acting is perfect, the special effects are top notch, and this is the best book adaptation i have ever seen. MUST WATCH!"
4,5.0,What an amazing series! I want to read the books but i'd like to finish the series first which is the opposite of what I usually like to do. I rarely go into a movie or series blind but I have enjoyed it thus far. I really can't wait to see what happens next!
4,4.5,Game of Thrones Season 4 may be the best game of thrones season to date. We get more character development and more notably plot development.
4,5.0,"*Warning: major spoilers ahead* Very few television shows are able to continue improving and improving after already delivering an amazing opening season. Well, Game of Thrones remains in that utterly prestigious list with its relentlessly shocking content. I can honestly say that Im a hard man to please as Ive seen many stories and witnessed plenty of twists and turns in the past. At this point, Im rarely bewildered by an unexpected event. You would think that with the multitude of left-turns that came in the prior seasons, Id already keep myself fully prepared for anything to happen. I just didnt know that literally meant anything. To have one of the most hated and memorable villains in any shownot just this onekilled off in the first few episodes is an accomplishment only Game of Thrones can boast. To have the second most powerful and menacing villain of the show killed off in its last minutes took me by surprise yet again! But wait, theres even more: a match between a viper and a mountain that remained tenser than any UFC and boxing match Ive ever seen before only to force me to stand up and groan in sheer stupefaction at its finish. Then, we had the colossally-scoped battle of Castle Black (continuing the tradition of penultimate episodes) that appeared to possess production value which matched Lord of the Rings. The fact of the matter is that Ive never come across a single narrative as tremendously unpredictable as this groundbreaking television hit. Essentially, it stands as a grand chess board that sees its chess pieces moving in completely unexpected ways. Actually, instead of the chess board having only two opposing sidesthis time, it has four or even more; think about that! Every characterminor or majoris developed enough for the audience to invest in. When I was criticizing The Walking Dead of how not to approach character development, this is exactly how you approach character development. In this case, theyre not necessarily lying around a bonfire and revealing their entire pasts in the least subtle manner. Their personalities, beliefs, and attitudes are more slowly fleshed out while something is actually transpiring. Theres no need to conspicuously and jarringly alternate between an intense, entertaining moment and a far slower-paced moment where the characters simply converse. With Game of Thrones, the two are often combined, which leads to the most effective and believable of characterization. Another significant and frequently overlooked element of the show is its impeccable display of acting craft. Peter Dinklage excellently conveys that repression of frustration on his face as hopelessness shadows the hapless and impotent dwarf, Tyrion. Emilia Clarke allows for compassion and authoritative might to coexist through her imposing mannerisms as the strong-willed and careful Daenerysmother of two quickly-growing dragons. Every actor/character in the cast is able to bring their own temperament and purpose to the arching tale. Paths cross and advance; friendships commence and falter; men ascend to power and diminish. At the end of the day, the unbelievably monumental scale of this show is unrivaled in film or television, and this is certainly its best season yet."
4,5.0,"Peter Dinklage is the highlight of the season. La muerte de Joffrey, el Juicio de Tyrion, Red Viper vs la montaña, y la venganza de Tyrion Lannister best season finale so far."
4,4.5,Easily the most satisfying season thus far.... starting strong and escalating to even epic proportions. All of this while delivering on more unexpected edge-of-your-seat plot twists and moving the story forward.
4,5.0,"It's becoming a bit hard for me to evaluate an episode of GoT, much less a season since this is such a carefully constructed show that will make much more sense or pay off once it ends. Actually, by becoming too serialized, it's when it gets a bit bumpy, for instance leaving all the good bits (so to speak) on the last 3 episodes. All the twists, turns and WTF moments happened a bit throughout the book, not just by the end but I respect what the screenwriters are doing, which is top-notch at every turn. Those nitpick moments arise, sure but they stand out because everything is so excellent that when something crumbles a bit, it's noticeable. But who knows, maybe that thing you didn't like will show up later on the show with a huge payoff, it's been done here already so have some patience. Still, despite prefering to evaluate all of this once it ends, this is still the best television or tv series or just series (thanks Netflix), whatever you wanna call it, around. It's intriguing, features plenty of satisfying deaths, amazingly acted, gorgeous views and most importantly, timeless human themes, such as love, parenthood, vengeance, acceptance by the family and plenty of other juice. Condensing all this with fantasy elements and excitment on just 10 episodes is remarkable to say the least."
4,4.5,"The season was close to perfection but the hyper action packed scenes episodes followed by slower plots with a certain shocking death turned to be predictable. However, it's one hell of a ride throughout the Seven Kingdoms plots and the finale sets the table for an even greater, bigger, heart stroking season."
4,5.0,Game of Thrones continues to be one of the finest series ever produced with its combination of superb production values and fantastic dark storytelling. Season 4 continues the series winning streak offering plenty of twists and turns and often effects work that is nearly worthy of the big screen. This season ups the fantasy elements more than previous seasons but still never loses focus on political manipulating and the journey of its characters. Television at its finest
4,5.0,"Brutal yet satisfying, and most of all brilliantly plotted and developed, season 4 brings the audience both joy and heartbreak, as well as Peter Dinklage's best performance in the series."
4,4.0,A quality adaptation show with stunning production design; the new season's story conveyed very well considered the change from the novel. Although the editing was not delivered the same impact which misled some powerful scenes as result.
4,5.0,"Another epic season for Game of Thrones, that certainly justifies it's hefty season price tag by giving us perhaps the most impressive battle sequences to ever be shot for television. There was brutality and character deaths a plenty this season, yet it never lost the humanity factor that has made the series so adorned, and there were plenty of tender moments to bring levity. Also, you can tell the writers have come onto their own with the series, as the original/altered material still rang true to George R.R. Martin's vision, and if anything only enhanced the story. Possibly the best season yet, for a series that hasn't held back an ounce since it's premiere."
4,4.5,"Tirando dois episódios ""mais chatos"", foram oito incríveis. O maior problema é esperar até o ano que vem pra ver desenrolar tanta coisa incrível que aconteceu neste último episódio (e mais coisas que ainda nem apareceram). :("
4,4.0,Game Of Thrones - My review: GOOD.
4,5.0,"Melhor série da atualidade. Personagens interessantes e cativantes envoltos em uma trama intrincada e complexa. Vale muito a pena acompanhar, pois o retorno é satisfatório. Nem uma série de fantasia trouxe esse realismo e inteligência de forma que prendesse o telespectador na poltrona."
4,5.0,"The only problem with this show is that it isn't 52 episodes a year. Greatly cast, well woven story, that keeps you interested the whole time. One of the better overal stories i have seen put to film ever."
4,5.0,"Simply the best serie of all time. Winter is coming, after all!"
4,3.5,"episode 9 is filled with one of the worst battles sequences i've ever seen. taking time out while there are flaming arrows all around you to converse has always pissed me off in other movies and shows and it seems no one took notice how badly it was put together. this is by far my least favorite episode of the 4th season. i think most of you are rating blindly out of your love for the show in general; there's no reason at all that this episode should be at 98%. there's no reason why the Crows waiting to protect the inner gate should have just stood there and watch as the giant came charging towards them. they just stood there and discussed it...why they weren't using arrows to start with is beyond me and why they didn't just easily stick their swords in him when he was ramming the gate directly in front of them. that's when they could've just easily sliced into him all at once. but alas, they all just died. nope, didn't see THAT one coming at all! this episode was filled with misguided direction. seems to me, as long as there are axes and spears and heads flying all over the place, it's enough to keep you completely enthralled, no matter how badly choreographed the scene comes out.....shame. still a great show, but the fact that you people gave it a 98% just lets me know that you're probably the same people who still watch the Walking Dead."
4,3.0,"A decent enough series, sadly marred. Some poor acting by minor players and unnecessary scenes of disturbing violence take the shine away. Worth a watch for a little closure from season 3."
4,5.0,"Last nights episode was amazing! Some surprising deaths for book readers, I'm sure!"
4,5.0,"the best thing, show ,movie ever nothing like this, before or after"
4,5.0,"Besides Code Geass and Death Note, this is considered the most complex TV show of all time."
4,5.0,The best show of all time.
4,5.0,maybe the best season so far
4,5.0,Excellent series. Very well written and directed. The acting is also top notch. They have created a very creative story that has a lot of moving parts. It's worth binge watching to make sure you follow all of the details that you might miss or forget between time seasons.
4,5.0,Best TV show hands down right now
4,5.0,"One of the best series that I have seen in a long long time. The writing, the acting, the story lines. everything from a-z is excellent in this series. It is so good that you just cannot wait till the next episode. It is a must see series."
4,4.0,the best tv series ever
4,5.0,I think everyone knows this is one of the best shows ever. Ever.
4,4.5,Absolutely great show and ep 2 was so awesome.
4,5.0,Gripping and the characters are deeply developed. Favorite of mine is clearly Peter Dinklage as Tyrion Lannister! What a character!
4,4.5,"41/2 stars and not 5 only because I like the show but it tends to drag for me on episodes where they differ from the books set chronology of events and go off on side-lines to give certain characters something to do when there is no mention of them in that part of the book. Still a great show though, especially if you enjoy gratuitous nudity and blood and gore!"
4,5.0,Peter Dinklage (tyrion Lannister) was just awesome in the 6th episode of 4th season....just loved it....
4,5.0,"Awsome!Along with Vikings, highly entertaining..."
4,5.0,"Yeah, it's that good"
4,4.0,"I'll give it 4 stars since Game of Thrones is my favorite show on tv, but the 4th season has proved that conversations and smart discussions became obsolete, and that killing characters is a good way to get good ratings."
4,4.5,I have learned the useful survival skill of NOT attending any weddings in Westeros.
4,5.0,"Amazing so far, although not as great as past seasons"
4,5.0,Love it Love it Love it.
4,4.5,"Not as spectacular as previous season have been, but the stellar cast and devious double crosses are as shocking and wonderous as ever."
4,3.5,Quarta temporada ta meia bomba!!
4,5.0,SPECTACULAR!!!!!!!!!
4,4.5,"Game of Thrones has been one of HBOs most highly watched and critically acclaimed series since its premiere in 2011, with its fourth season just having begun a few weeks ago. Fans that watch the show religiously, myself included, will always find a way to bring the series into a conversation, particularly when attempting to get non-viewers to watch the show. If youre a non-viewer and havent been in solitary confinement for the past four years, chances are youve encountered your fair share crazed fans raving about the brilliance of the series. It is with good reason that Game of Thrones has become a mainstream icon in recent years, because truly, there is nothing on television like it. The series follows a number of corrupt political figures that rule over the Seven Kingdoms of Westeros, a fictional continent occupied by a number of housesin more simplistic terms, families distinguished by their last name and a specific sigil, such as a wolf or a lion. From its gruesomely shocking climax in season one, it becomes apparent that Game of Thrones is not playing by the rules. Every consecutive season of the series examines the corruptions, perversions, and cunning acts of deceit that power ensues, especially to those willing to commit the darkest and most murderous acts to attain it. One of the most original aspects of Game of Thrones is its beautifully stylish ambiance and costume design. Because it is a fantasy tale, akin to that of Lord of the Rings, the setting and clothing are reminiscent of medieval times. Game of Thrones is uniquely stunning in its storytelling, filled with sorcery, demonic beings, supernatural abilities, and most grand of all, fire-breathing dragons. Despite its extraordinary originality, Game of Thrones is a darkly woeful series. Good does not always prevail, and fans have found themselves in utter disbelief watching their favorite characters slaughtered in the blink of an eye. No one is safe in Game of Thrones, making it both an exhilarating and anxiety-inducing watch. As of now, Game of Thrones is three episodes into its fourth season, and like every preceding season, it has failed to disappoint. Tensions are high as lies and murders ensue in the game of thronesno pun intendedmaking for a largely entertaining and promising season. As stated by Cersei Lannister, one of the main characters of the series, When you play the game of thrones, you win or you die. There is no middle ground. Indeed, the series has had its fair share of war and vengeance in the fight for powerthemes that will undoubtedly continue as the show progresses. It may come as no surprise that Game of Thrones has been my favorite television series for the past four years and will likely continue to be in the years to come. Ultimately, Game of Thrones is gripping from the start to its most recent episode and is not a series to be missed. It is a political and mythological masterpiece filled with blood, sweat, and tears for its characters and fans alikeminus the blood for fans, I would hope."
4,5.0,BEST SHOW ON TV. KEEPS GETTING BETTER AND BETTER.
4,5.0,"GRR Martin's colossal and breathtaking fantasy saga is back, stronger and better than ever before."
4,4.5,I love this show. I just wish the different storylines would intercept more often than they do. Too many characters to follow at times
4,4.0,http://allmyvideos.net/ybnvb8siqttp
4,5.0,"Just a fantastic show! There really is not much more to say then that. The acting is great, the story is great, and the CGI is spot on! If there is a negative to the show/series, it is that I constantly get attached to characters that eventually are beheaded, stabbed, or ""red-weddinged""!"
4,5.0,"Game of Thrones is the best show ever made. There's just enough punch in this show from the start to the end. This season is almost as good as the 3rd but slightly fades out because of a bit- a tiny bit of a weaker ending compared to the third season. This time around, they changed the usual magnanimity of the penultimate episode and there by proved to you that the show is still unpredictable. George R.R. Marin is the world's biggest sadist and the writers of the show always tried to out beat him and they succeeded in the 8th episode of the season. I mean, what an ending that was? Did you expect it? No. The same twist in the book was a bit more lifeless because Oberyn Martell never managed to stab The Mountain twice and he was not such an attractive character in the book. The Red Viper dies(in the book) when the Mountain smashes him all over the face until his skull caves in. But the ending of the 8th episode was way too superior than all of that. It's also important to acknowledge the importance of the second, fifth and fourth episodes. In fact all the episodes were great this season. The best of them was the 6th episode, The Laws of Men and Gods. I mean Peter Dinklage simply owns this season. Just thinking about his acting from this episode gives me chills and also if that wasn't enough, then what about the small guy's show in the Mockingbird, 7th episode? I still remember his expressions when he understands about the cruelty that Cersei did to him when he was born. The 9th episode did not have the emotional resonance of the previous episodes, but it still is an improvement from what was there in the fourth book Feast for the Crows, remember how it flopped back in 2005. The 10th episode was good as well and it became the best ending episode of GoT thus far. Jaime Lannister was given a lot of role in the series when compared to the fact that he has too few scenes in the book, especially those with Tyrion. Arya Stark is really irritating this season, but she is moderately enjoyable in the last episode. However Sansa Stark has begun to receive more importance this season and it's good."
4,5.0,"Whatever you're doing, put it down, park your ass in front of your television, and allow yourself to indulge in what could be the best TV series out there."
4,5.0,"Honestly, there's not much need for explanation anymore on this series' greatness -- just watch it -- you won't regret it, whatsoever."
4,5.0,The best show ever! Addicting and its based on George R. R. Martins books
4,5.0,Wow!!! Episode 2 was very satisfying. Keep em coming!
4,5.0,"Two episodes in, and i've already decided this is the best season yet."
4,5.0,The only TV series that made me addicted to it.
4,5.0,"Game of Thrones for me is the best ever television series I have seen. With a fantastic cast including big names like Peter Dinklage, Lena Headey, Charles Dance and Sean Bean and newcomers like Nikolaj Coster-Waldau, Kit Harington and Emilia Clarke. Also, child actors Maisie Williams and Isaac Hempstead Wright have also been very impressive. Game Of Thrones is about seven noble families fighting for control of the mythical land of Westeros. The series has a fantastic storyline based on the books by George R.R Martin and creators David Benioff and D,B Weiss have done a superb job to emulate the greatness of the books into the series. It has everything, Action, Love, Revenge, Blood, Sex and Humour making it an attraction to a vast range of audiences. Scriptually the series is near perfect, helped by the high calibre actors that bring the tale to life. Visually the series is on the same level as the greatest of films, thanks to their lengthy spending power, this makes the series even more enjoyable. The CGI is very impressive, showing the most realistic dragons I have ever seen. The series is riveting and you wont be able to take your eyes off the television screen. If you enjoyed the books, you will love the series!"
4,5.0,It has a way of drawing you in and keeping you there. Must see TV.
4,4.5,It's just going to get better from here on out.
4,5.0,"Even from the first episode,Game of Thrones manages to capture the attention of those who are new to the show, and further excite the long time viewers. With an impeccable cast, beautiful production design, and a script that manages to remain true to the books all the while putting its own twist on it, makes Game of Thrones a show of the highest quality."
4,5.0,"Excellently written, impeccable cast and acted, stunning production design, and brilliantly scripted, Game of Thrones is one of the best TV series on air. Everything from the cinematography to the costuming perfectly drives the mood of each scene, be it an intense battle or an equally intense and suspenseful conversation between two characters. The many characters each have unique dimensions, and their individual stories brilliantly tie to the others. Truly a fantasy masterpiece of our generation."
4,5.0,By far the best series on TV.
4,5.0,Better than life it's so good!
4,5.0,"Awesome Awesome Awesome !!!! As good as it was in season 1, 2 and 3. Probably best series ever made. A true must see."
4,1.0,A complete waste of time watching fake stories of fake kings in a deviant overcast of poor imagery and plot. Soap operas would be less of a waste of time. For the cerebrally challenged.
4,5.0,Season 4's first 2 episodes are my 2 most favorite episodes! hahaha
4,5.0,I'm so excited to see this I'm actually losing control of my faculties!
4,5.0,"Best fantasy show hands down! its gory, its violent, it has various amazing plot lines, and it had dragons, what more could you ask for?"
4,5.0,"This is Westeros. Bloods will flow, plots will brew, kings will become, dragons will rise and winter will come. This is rare epic storytelling. Nothing can beat the grandeur of this fantasy phenomena. This is among the creamy layers of bucket list entertainment."
4,5.0,"Season four of Game of Thrones is as good as its third season, which is pretty damn great. You wont see any real Red Wedding caliber shocks but this season is full of plenty others. Peter Dinklage gives what could possibly be his best performance on the show so far and as usual the ninth episode promises to be one of the most exciting of this year. The finale is an improvement over last seasons and really gives you a lot to look forward to for the next season. In fact it may be the shows best finally to date. Overall Game of Thrones reigns king this year again as televisions best show. 5/5"
4,5.0,"Game of thrones continues to raise the bar as one of the best, well scripted, perfectly made Television shows to date. Its beautifully crafted world and great cast of characters continues to keep us absorbed in the world of westeros, as well as delivering unexpected twists and drama points that keep us engaged till the very end of each episode"
4,5.0,Simply the Best Show in TV history
4,5.0,"one of the best series of all time, game of thrones gaders all the essence of the GEORGE R.R.MARTIN books has...great special CGI effects,great actors,great directing...i highly recomend game of thrones."
4,3.5,"A step back, but the last three episodes are very well done."
4,5.0,"HBO's hit show returns with the fourth season, which is based on the second half of the third book, A Storm of Swords. Continuing on from the amazing cliffhanger that ended season three, this season takes us into new plot threads, introduces new characters and adds further mysteries to the plot of the show. As with the first three seasons, this season doesn't disappoint. While it's a little slow in the first few episodes, it gets going, with great patience. Most of the storyline with Tyrion Lannister is centered around a courtroom hearing deciding if he is in fact guilty for the murder of King Joffrey. Other major characters have their own storylines: Arya and the Hound traveling to the Eyrie, Daenerys claiming power over the city of Mereen and liberating the slaves, Sansa and Petyr arriving to the Eyrie and Jon Snow and the Night's Watch preparing for a huge battle against the Wildlings. As usual the special effects are highly professional, as is the case with the dragons and the huge battle in episode nine, The Watches on the Wall. The cinematography is outstanding, supporting the different storylines and locations, and Ramin Djawadi's score is absolutely breathtaking supporting many characters. The two best episodes of this season are episodes nine and ten. Nine centers around a huge battle and is directed by Neil Marshall, who had directed the ninth episode of season two, Blackwater. Marshall once again proves successful at handling battle scenes, while this episode is very different from the one in season two. Episode ten concludes the entire season, with each character going into a new story, leading into season five. The cast is terrific, with Emilia Clarke wonderfully showing Daenerys as a strong-willed female liberator, Nikolaj Coster-Waldau bringing sympathy to his role of Jamie Lannister, Lena Headey still being as merciless and cold as ever as Cercei Lannister and Kit Harrington proving himself to be rather successful as Jon Snow. Peter Dinklage once again still steals the show as Tyrion Lannister. His best performance comes in episode six, where he gives a commanding and strong performance. Pedro Pascal is a wonderful addition as Oberyn Martel, who wants vengeance against the Lannisters for the murder of his sister. This season, after watching it, proves why Game of Thrones is not only a great show, but also successful, original and very intricate."
4,2.0,"Several storylines have been dragged out to fit into a ten episode arch, and its pretty clear in some places."
4,4.0,The most best series since 2011.
4,5.0,My favorite season overall of Game of Thrones.
4,3.0,"The new season premieres on HBO, April 6, I suggest, if you want to catch up, buy seasons one, two and three that comes out today. Shop around for the best price, unless you're in Kenora, Ontario, then of course, go see my friends at MOVIES ON MAIN."
4,5.0,"During its four year run, for three of those years its consistently been the best thing on TV. Everyone running and starring in this great adaptation is at the top of their trade. It's almost as good as the books."
4,5.0,"Continuing off of what was probably the most shocking moment on television last year, Season 4 of Game of Thrones delivers even more than the previous three."
4,4.5,Unbelievably getting better and better. Outstanding and shocking drama. Pure entertainment.
5,4.5,"Still going strong with amazing acting and some of the most memorable scenes and plot twists. Possibly the last ""Almost Perfect"" game of thrones seasons. I don't remember exactly if the next one is as good (it's been a while since I watched it first)."
5,5.0,"George R. R. Martin criou um universo riquíssimo e ""Game of Thrones"" trouxe isso à vida de uma forma que poucas séries conseguiram fazer."
5,0.5,Baaaad poooosseeey...
5,4.5,"By this time, your attachment to the Game of Thrones characters is what continues leading this show to be the best ever created"
5,5.0,Melhor série do mundo!
5,5.0,My favorite season so far
5,4.0,The season is great but I didn't like the fact that the high sparrow has power above the king and queen
5,4.5,"Another great season of Game of Thrones! The stakes are higher than ever, making everything more exciting with more epic clashes. The final episode is truly incredible, with wall to wall surprises and great action scenes, along with some very emotional moments."
5,5.0,Another brilliant season that focus more on the story and character development but it still feels epic and heartbreaking.
5,3.0,Writing : 7/10 Acting : 10/10 Cinematography : 9/10 Costume design : 10/10 Set design : 10/10 CGI Effects 9/10 Artistic vision 7/10 Adaptation ranking : 6/10
5,4.5,"Loses a half star because the storyline of the high sparrow is terrible. It just doesn't make sense that he would have so much power, to the point that the king is powerless against him. Otherwise the show is still brilliant."
5,1.0,Great story overshadowed by relentless chauvinism and tryhard shock value
5,4.5,Another great season of Game of Thrones. Production quality continues to improve as popularity for the show grows to new heights. I never felt bored or wanting more from the season. Only reason it is not 5/5 is because I didnt think it was the best season (season 6).
5,4.5,"Good series, i still prefer the previus seasons."
5,4.5,"Bloody action and extreme power plays return full throttle, as Game of Thrones enjoys a new-found liberation from the world of the source material, resulting in more unexpected thrills."
5,4.5,"Really good except for any scene with the sand snakes, they are super cringe"
5,4.5,"Meandering at times, the fifth GOT season still offers a lot of payoffs in the final few episodes with the best action thus far. The atmosphere is gritty and bleak, and the characters are given way more depth than ever before. The cast is on-point from episode to episode, and the visual mastery is ever-present with its depiction of harsh thematics coming shining through."
5,5.0,"Ok season 5 still went strong, love each character and love it"
5,3.5,It's good but not as half as a good as the first few seasons.
5,5.0,"Brilliant! This season had a lot of epic moments, and also a lot of dark and twisted moments."
5,3.0,"Season 5 GoT is where things officially go off the rails, the showrunners run out of source material to adapt, and what they create in its absence is mediocre to say the least."
5,4.0,"Season 5 is where things start to take a turn for Game of Thrones. They start to run out of books to adapt... Don't get me wrong, this is still very good and fun to watch, but especially the dialogue is considerably worse than in the previous seasons. Overall this season still has solid writing, great scenes and good acting, but it doesn't reach the level of the previous seasons. Still a very good season though."
5,2.5,The season where everything started to fall apart
5,5.0,The Sansa and Ramsay love story was so special ...And I'm here for it!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
5,4.5,Almost as awesome as previous seasons.
5,4.5,Very strong season of the show. Ending was a bit off but the season was strong. Great character arcs.
5,3.5,"Season 5 is truly when the stress of the complex narrative begins to weigh heavily on the series as a whole. Now, with the source material running short, is when issues that could easily be brushed aside previously present themselves front and foremost. This was the first season where I truly began questioning characters actions, whether it be for the fact it did not match that of their literary counterparts, or because I truly did not understand what they were going for at this point. While it is absolutely acceptable to not fully comprehend a characters actions (as has been paramount for most of the series with the character's and narrative's complexities), this is the first season in which it feels as though characters begin to act completely contrary to what appears to be their goals, and for no solid reason. Sadly, I initially believed this was only due to the complexity of the narrative, rather than an unwillingness to execute on the premise, as it eventually turned out to be."
5,5.0,"Few series quite as perfect as this one. Just one thing,,,,did winter ever really come?"
5,5.0,Absolutely brilliant loved it the mix of medieval theme and fantasy and white walkers horror it's brilliant and love it and the battle Sean's are amazing and brings the horror of battle to life like I've never seen before on a historical battlefields and dialogue all great
5,0.5,"Knock knock, who's there? Santa! You've been a naughty boy, here's a fifth season of the most boring show you can think of!"
5,5.0,Another fantastic season!!!
5,3.5,"A shocking drop in quality for what was possibly the most outstanding fantasy series ever made, this season is undoubtedly watchable, and is still very good, but is mostly set up for a better season."
5,5.0,la accion sangrienta y el juego de poder regresan mas rapido que nunca con una gran temporada
5,4.0,"Even I started to get exhausted of all that training with the faceless man. Enough already. Kings Landing was invaded by the boring, too. Stannis = boring. Thank God for Jon Snow's hair and the Night King, or I might not have rushed back."
5,5.0,Continues to be great.
5,4.5,My rating for the s5 is a 9.0/10
5,4.5,"Meandering at times, the fifth GOT season still offers a lot of payoffs in the final few episodes with the best action thus far. The atmosphere is gritty and bleak, and the characters are given way more depth than ever before. The cast is on-point from episode to episode, and the visual mastery is ever-present with its depiction of harsh thematics coming shining through."
5,4.0,"Essa temporada foi muito boa mas não conseguiu ser melhor que a anterior. O final foi muito marcante, trazendo um grande mistério para a próxima temporada com o futuro dos personagens, principalmente com o Jon Snow."
5,5.0,esta temporada es grande con mucha accion sangrienta
5,3.5,"Season 4 was great... season 5, not so much. The writing wasn't as crisp as previous seasons. D&D replaced dialogue and deep conversations with unsatisfying action and poor character endings. I wanted to like this season more, but by midway through, I could tell it wasn't going to be as good as earlier seasons, and it stayed that way until the end."
5,4.0,"Great season, but it lacked a bit of good dialogues...also more stereotypical and cliché-like than the first 4 seasons"
5,4.0,"Incredible show, at least till it follows the books. After it surpasses the books, problems start. Last season is best not mentioned."
5,5.0,The old Stark has gone.
5,4.0,"The show had dipped in the quality of its writing and character charisma (what made the show so captivating), but otherwise still a solid season."
5,4.0,"A season of highs and lows. At its best, the season delivers many more iconic scenes to a show filled with iconic scenes and whole episodes are amazing, hands down. On the other hand, there are also more original content in this season than earlier and unfortunately it is quite bad at times. The Dorne storyline is plagued by some genuinely bad writing in parts. The show has also started killing characters at an exponential rate culminating in the season finale and unfortunately the viewer becomes somewhat desensitized to some of it."
5,3.5,Clumsy plot lines and a sluggish pace bring down what is otherwise a fairly solid season.
5,4.0,Everything was great except the Dorne plot. The Dornishmen are such great and interesting characters in the books but they sucked in the show.
5,5.0,Absolutely Great.. The show maintains it's Glorious story. At the end everyone will be sad.
5,3.0,"By far the weakest season of the show. The Kings Landing story is much less interesting, as some of the best characters moved onto other settings. Some characters had good arcs but most of it was setting up for the later seasons and some arcs felt like filler."
5,4.0,"The fifth season somewhat follows the fourth and fifth books with some major changes here and there. Good adaptation with memorable characters and episodes. The first step back in the series. They could've used the source materials more, but the end result is still entertaining."
5,5.0,Season 5 continues to keep the quality of the previous seasons and keeps the level of the show as one of the best ever made.
5,5.0,Awesome bro great action
5,5.0,"Após um forte quarto ano, Game of Thrones entra na fase do filler e da enrolação. A quinta temporada herda alguns dos fatores menos empolgantes dos livros, e joga Tyrion em uma narrativa monótona com Daenerys. O que salva é mesmo a excelente batalha em Durolar, lá para o final da temporada. Pra mim a pior temporada de Game of Thrones empatada com a oito simplesmente da oito ser o final e ser mais importante!"
5,3.0,"I like it... but it has been taking me a long time to watch it. So far, it is the worst season, I haven't seen an episodes of the show since episode 7 (very bad episode)."
5,4.5,"Season five is a slow and calculated burn that gradually builds up the tension, with the back half of its run representing some of the show's finest moments thus far."
5,5.0,"Another absurd reiteration to what is, in my not so humble opinion, one of the best content in television history."
5,5.0,"As far as we know, Jon Snow dies in the season finale (he gets revived in like episode 2 of season 6) and I love how Tyrion meets Daenerys, and I also love when Daenerys flies off with her dragons in one of the episodes, and I just love how this season is like the beginning of the end I feel like."
5,0.5,"Easily the worst season of the entire show. Yes, including season 8. Hardhome is horrendously overrated by fools, as is the Battle of the Bastards."
5,5.0,"The best show ever by far, it's just spectacular !!!"
5,1.0,Avoid this and all following seasons.
5,5.0,You can start to see some decline from s04 but this season has one of the best Battles of the series and a fantastic finale.
5,4.0,Game of Thrones Season 5 | Detailed note: 8.9
5,4.0,Almost perfect but the Sparrow storyline is kind of a drag.
5,0.5,Most overrated show of all time I was waiting for some character or even just some welly filmed action but never got either in all of these seasons
5,4.5,"again a masterpiece, but a boring one."
5,5.0,wait what? even better than s4
5,4.0,واحد من افضل المواسم في المسلسل مع تدفق احداث ثابت
5,5.0,"Even if u hated the ending this is by far the greatest show of all time. Each episode keeps u on the edge of your seat. Never have i ever heard as many people talk about whats gunna happen next week. There was just a lot of people upset because they didn't get what they want but that is what the whole show was, you never got what u want."
5,5.0,Wow that cliff hanger has struck my head too hard!what an amazing season at first i thought the show lost its essences yet great ending episodes!
5,5.0,Exceptional depth and brilliance. A world of such vast imagination and unrivaled storytelling with an achievement in visuals never before seen in television. 9.6/10
5,4.5,This season was great. I loved Margaery and Arya and Tyrion. Dany was starting to get a bit annoying for me but it fit with her character. Cersei is starting to decline. The ending of this season is completely shocking and reveals a lot about Cersei. In a messed up way it made you root for a child killing themselves because everything Cersei did was to protect her children and now her actions are what caused their deaths. This season really emphasized on Cersei's character and revealed a lot more about her. Overall just a great season.
5,5.0,"best, it was really good, i enjoyed it. please give us no2 etc asap. as I WANT MORE !!!!"
5,3.0,Let's say that the writer have lost their way (probably just lost Martin's ideas) and they are saved by the characters appeal.
5,2.0,You can tell the exact moment when the directors ran out of source material to adapt. Please ask any viewer to recount the events of this season - I guarantee they'll struggle.
5,3.5,Ehh. The first season without George R. R. Martin helping with the writing.. And it clearly shows. Most of the episodes are skippeable with most plot points going no where.
5,4.5,"Not as amazing as the past few seasons, but worth the watch. Carried on many threads from before with an evolving world."
5,5.0,"Still beautiful, still a great story, the characters are still true themselves along with a character arch."
5,3.5,"It's pretty typical that a story with multiple povs will have some storylines that are weaker than others, but I feel like this was the first season when that really started to become a problem. Something about the pacing falls apart in places, but it's still very entertaining."
5,4.5,"Season 5 nails some storylines better than others, but it's still consistently entertaining and throws many of its characters in new directions. (A-)"
5,1.0,Terrible season. Characters and storylines so unlikeable that many scenes had to be fast-forwarded
5,0.5,"The story of game of thrones is fake, wrong and family destroying. full of sad scenes like rape, killing innocent people, adult parts. all the people slept together.!!! Too bad"
5,2.0,Where the show started going down hill and away from the source material.
5,5.0,BY FAR for me the best season!
5,4.0,"As GoT begins to run out of source material, the storytelling and characterisation are a bit less consistent than in previous seasons. However, season 5 contains some mind-blowing individual episodes, and the overall story still keeps you hooked in."
5,4.5,And here is where I run into trouble rating Okay I have too many thoughts I feel like everyone else's opinions on the later seasons got into my heads
5,3.5,"Good, like season 2 it had a slow plot but they were just building up for the next season"
5,5.0,"My absolute favourite season of Game of Thrones, it is dark, bloody, action packed, strong in plot and story, full of character growth, and so many surprises you can't imagine."
5,4.0,empieza genial y la muerte de jon nieve no me la esperaba por eso me encanta esta serie
5,5.0,One of my favourite shows.
5,3.5,Lots of deviation from the books and some awful writing in places - eg. the Dornish storyline where Jaime and Bronn try to rescue Myrcella. The books have a sensible Dornish plot and the TV show completely disregards it and other logical parts of the books and replaces them with terrible writing. Another example of terrible story telling is the addition of Olly who becomes a member of the Night's Watch - this guy isn't in the books and nobody cares about him. Everytime I saw this dumb character I was irritated by the complete disregard for George's far better writing. Worse than seasons 1-4 but nowhere near as bad as seasons 7 & 8.
5,4.5,"I think season 5 is when most people started to notice some problems in Game of Thrones. Notably, there were several things that were presented in a certain way, only to be contradicted later. I really like season 5, but to me its obvious that it is the true start of the downward spiral. But even with its problems, it was still one of the greatest shows on television."
5,5.0,"Full of surprises and plenty of violence, Season 5 of Game of Thrones is the best season the series has done yet."
5,4.5,All very amazing unless you count the Sand Snakes and the Sansa- Ramsey marriage.
5,3.5,"There's no denying the greatness of this show, but man they really screwed up the landing with Stannis."
5,1.5,"I'm only giving this half a star more because while it's so utterly terrible of a season, I don't think it was as bad as Season 7 and Season 8 was. If you don't know Dorne in the books, then you probably won't understand why this season was as bad as it was, but still you should've gotten some clue from what they did with the Sandsnakes, and the Twenty Good Men. Truly a tragic turning point, especially considering how amazing Season 4 was."
5,4.5,"Though I enjoyed this season (the season finale was fantastic), I feel like it only gets into it's stride during the last part of the season, with the story line in Dorne and the Sparrows drama dragging it down slightly. But I still think it's worthy of a high rating for the battle at Hardhome alone."
5,3.5,"A slow season that only ends with three great episodes, the rest is not interesting enough for viewers to care, Arya's storyline seemed like it would be great but falls flat, everything in Dorne is tonally different from the storyline, in Essos is a rebellion against Daenerys or something and it's boring, King's Landing characters are also boring, Castle Black/Jon, Tyrion and Jorah's story are the heavy lifters of the season, overall there's small things and the final three episodes that make up for the season being bad."
5,5.0,"Season 5 is where the writing changes from a pure and simple adaptation of the existing early books while not knowing where the story is headed, to the creation of a television narrative focused on a known ending via the adaption of some existing book material and creation of the rest based on George RR Martin's general guidelines. As a result the feel of the writing shifts; if one can adjust to this and appreciate it for what it offers – as I did – S5, and the show, continues to present a brilliant dramatic experience. While dark, I thought Season 5 was great."
5,5.0,"Super cool, Amazing i haven´t words to describ this show!"
5,4.5,Still a great show but seems that they are starting to focus more on action than the dialogue that made GOT so famous.
5,4.0,"At Season 5, the show begins to branch off from the earlier seasons' faithfulness to the books, yet it still remains something of a masterpiece."
5,3.5,apparently i cant write a review on season 4 but as for this season it is the season where the show went down in quality their destroyed stannis as a character still worth watching tho
5,5.0,"Even when I think that this show can't get better it gets better and it is still my 2nd favorite tv show of all time. The lead acting performances from Peter Dinklage, Maisie Williams, Kit Harington, Emilia Clarke, Gwendoline Christie, Iwan Rheon, Sophie Turner, Lena Headey, Natalie Dormer, and Alfie Allen were excellent and the supporting performances from Jerome Flynn, Tom Wlaschiha, Conleth Hill, Stephen Dillane, John Bradley, Diana Rigg, Aidan Gillen, Dean-Charles Chapman, Rosabell Laurenti Sellers, Hannah Murray, Daniel Portman, Ian Whyte, Nathalie Emmanuel, Iain Glen, Tara Fitzgerald, Jonathan Pryce, and Indira Varma were fantastic. The storytelling and writing this season was wonderful. The fighting and battle scenes were awesome especially the battle in the Daznak Pit between the Unsullied and Drogon against the Sons of the Harpy, the battle between the Wildlings against the Wight's, the battle between the Sons of the Harpy against the Unsullied, the fight between Jorah against the other fighters in the Daznak Pit, and the fight between Jaime and Bron against the Dorne soldiers. The visual effects were outstanding this season especially Daenerys riding on Drogon, Drogon the Dragon, and the Skeleton Wights and the undead. The makeup effects were terrific especially the Night King, the undead people, the White Walkers, and Wun Wun the Giant. The props, costumes, and accessories were splendid especially all of the weapons used (especially Jon Snows sword Longclaw), all of Emilia Clarke's outfits, and Daenerys silver Dragon necklace. The music and score in this season was great as all of the music and scores in the other seasons have been. The last scene was good but it is my least favorite last scene but it did have a great shock factor. Overall this was another A+ season of Game of Thrones."
5,5.0,This season contains the single greatest television episode of all time. Episode 8: Hardhome. Watch it!
5,5.0,Such a powerful season.
5,4.5,GoT 5th season was full of surprises. Great stories. The House of Black and White is one not to missed. Jon Snow is starting to be noticed as a leader.
5,5.0,the show just gets better and better
5,5.0,better than later seasons
5,2.5,Season 5 has great storytelling but is ruined by subplots like Dorne.
5,0.5,"Barely anything of note happens in this season, and it culminates to a very boring finale."
5,4.5,"All wonderful, just these sandsnakes... could have been wonderful, just please don't try selling me these girls as badasses"
5,2.0,Sand snakes and mom paramour casting is found wanting.
5,4.0,The sixth episode brought my rating down a notch but besides that it's an okay season.
5,5.0,"Finally a show without those stupid Hollywoodish, PG-13 happy endings. Something serious."
5,5.0,"jon becomes a crow, high sparrow comes into play. lots of birds in this one."
5,5.0,Best show on TV. top 3 best show of all time
5,4.0,"Game of Thrones continues its exciting run in season five, packed with big twists and lavish set-pieces, but occasionally stumbles in its balancing act in maintaining consistency amongst its many stories."
5,5.0,The books where amazing and the show is extremely engaging!
5,3.5,Hated The dornish and Tyrion story line rest was good.
5,4.5,"Although lack of book material can be evidence in the drop of dialogue quality and plot development, Season 5 is still a superb tale that has some of the most powerful moments in the series, and where we also see the grand story reach slowly but steadily its final act."
5,1.0,Adaption: Grade D Faithful of Source: No (Due not having 20 Episodes for Novel 1) Faithful of Characters: No (Due not having 20 Episodes for Novel 1)
5,4.5,"Diverging from the books into their own storylines, Game of Thrones continues to be thought-provoking and addictive drama."
5,4.5,A bit of a setback after three phenomenal seasons but still an excellent television series.
5,5.0,"Story, Cast, Acting, VFX etc every is Tremendous also Most Realistically Written Series, Realism means nothing blurred or muted or cut e.g. Sex Scenes & violence Scenes which makes it different from other TV series & Amazing & Realistic... Also High Fantasy, Kings, Queen, Wars, White Walker (Snow Monsters) & Dragons Makes it Great High fantasy TV Series... To the point & Close to the Book, This TV series is Magnificent & Excellent, I Really Liked it Rated 10/10 Regards"
5,4.0,"After having a great time with season 4, back again to the same problem with the first 3 seasons.. BOREDOM! And I thought that I will never feel it again, after season 4. But here we are again, poor stuff happening, until episode 7! It actually went worse than the first one in those 7 episode, but once again they needed a savior, but this time their saviors were totally powerful, especially episode 8! Because of their three saviors, I liked this season, but stills, a big step back!"
5,5.0,"In Season 5, Games of Thrones delves deeper into uncharted TV territory with its darkest, most sharply plotted, and most thematic season thus far, complete with a host of exotic new locations."
5,5.0,"Cersei meets the High Sparrow. Arya reaches Bravoos and Tyrion joins Daenerys on her quest to the Iron Throne. Wildlings come to The Wall. This visually stunning show leaves us speechless, thrilled and wanting for more. Game of Thrones gets better, even than it already was in previous seasons."
5,5.0,What is going on here? The one who was the only favourite character just died.. Yes this season will take you to different ups and downs and as story progresses the center of story was never the iron throne.
5,4.0,good season but the sand snakes were annoying
5,3.5,This season get even more interesting with characters traveling all over and experiencing their biggest personal obstacles yet. This makes the series really binge worthy because the characters are in such traumatic situations all over their world that keep you invested. Betrayal and mind games as well as reunions amongst some of the characters.
5,3.5,"This is where the series finally starts to have problems. Everything technical with this season, especially the dragons and the look of the cities, are amazing. However, the dialogue, at some parts, is laughably bad. And Jorah is kind of useless and whiny in this season. His chemistry with Tirion really shouldn't be in here. It's still a solid season, just significantly worse than the previous seasons."
5,4.0,"Puntaje Original: 8.5 No puede presumir de ser tan genial como su predecesora, pero cielos, nos trae las escenas tanto crueles como sorprendentes hasta ahora vistas, que demuestran la capacidad de los creadores de asumir riesgos con la trama sin miedo para darnos una proeza narrativa que influenciará generaciones enteras."
5,4.0,Not my favorite season but the cast and cinematography keeps you invested in their character's world.
5,4.5,"Se pierde un poco el sentimiento de ver Game of Thrones, parece cambiar de tono y eso saca de la experiencia, aún así los acontecimientos son tan emocionantes que Game of Thrones ya es mi serie favorita."
5,3.5,The series began its slow crawl downward this season. Less character development and genuine drama by moving to manufactured soap opera with standard tv writing.
5,3.5,Game of Thrones: Season 5 Game of Thrones season five is too focused on their scattered character development yet somehow abandon the effective storytelling formula from the previous season.
5,4.5,"Another visual masterpiece, with writing and acting that are among the best in television. A lot of shows begin to fall off by this point, but Game of Thrones hasn't fallen at all."
5,5.0,The best produceed show ever for TV.
5,4.0,beastly. finally got to see a lot of what i've been waiting for. a step above the previous seasons (3 viewings)
5,4.0,"[CONTAINS SPOILERS] Despite everything that the 5 seasons of Game of Thrones has thrown up, the ending of the season 5 finale has rattled me a lot. I was left staring blankly and open mouthed at the black screen with the credits blinking and I barely registering them. Since then I have been pacing around my living room frantically muttering; No no no no no no  this is ridiculous!!! He was one of the bloody main characters!!! before venting my frustration on Twitter, and after sending an angry tweet, I resumed the pacing and shaking of head, exasperated exhales of breath and grumpily moaning; Im not having that. Im not having that!! Why?! Why Martin?!! Whyyyyy?!!!! This is probably the most unreviewish kind of blog post I will do, purely because I am typing this 30 minutes after witnessing a travesty of a finale! My favourite character Jon bloody Snow has been killed off! He was a hero! He was a good guy! He had a catchphrase about him! AARGHHHHH!!!!!! I will try and put emotions aside for the duration of this post, and write up a proper season review. Winter looks like it is actually coming! All the North peoples low voices warning of the impending winter and longest night looks like it is actually coming. Mid-season had a few flakes of snow falling from the air, but when Jon Snow ?? ventures North to get some Wildlings and Stannis marches to Winterfell, the snow seems to be coming down very heavily all of a sudden. And combined with the advancing numbers of White Walkers in episode 8 then the next season and probably the one after that will see them getting nearer and nearer towards the Wall and the Seven Kingdoms. One of the biggest talking points this season was one particular scene between Sansa and Ramsey with a watching Theon/Reek. Many called out Martin, writers and producers for using rape as a device. With Martin vehemently defended its inclusion http://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/jun/04/george-rr-martin-game-of-thrones-rape-reality-of-war Many websites have refused to cover any more reviews of Game of Thrones because of this. I found this quite weird to be honest, especially as Pulp Fiction is considered one of the greatest and most popular films of all time, it is number 5 on the list of IMDb best films and even Entertainment Weekly said it was the greatest film of all time http://www.ew.com/article/2007/06/18/new-classics-movies and it shows a brutal rape and gory murder, while Game of Thrones shows probably less than 10 seconds of ripping clothes and Sansa crying. I am not trying to condone or support either side; all I am saying is that these websites are angry at the Sansa rape scene when they rate Pulp Fiction as their best ever film. Season 5 has been very steady for episodes 1-7, but the last 3 were more like the Game of Thrones epic episodes that the fans were baying for. The scene in the gladiatorial arena similar to the Roman Colleseum was a fantastic return to form; it also bared some striking similarities to a scene in Star Wars. And many people on social media were wondering how Danaerys managed to ride Drogon with his spine spikes all along his back every inch or so, it must have been a very painful ride! We finally got to see some White Walker action in Hardhome (the best episode of the season) and we and Jon Snow witnessed how the dead become more soldiers in the White Walker army. This episode was probably the episode on a par with The Mountain and The Vyper and The Laws of Gods and Men from the previous season. I wrote this final paragraph before last nights episode. The one thing I love most about Game of Thrones is that everyone is portrayed as being an important character to the storyline and when the end comes, not all of them will be on the winning side. Their is Tyrion, Jamie, Cersei, Jon Snow, Ayra, Sansa, Danaerys and Bran they all seem to be presented as the survivors in Game of Thrones, and when the end finally comes, it will be interesting to see who is still living and who is not. And putting my reviewing and unbiased hat on for a brief moment, I can see why Martin does what he does, he has managed to create unpredictably and amazing storylines that readers and viewers are utterly awestruck by his work. It is the most frustrating, annoying, amazing and brilliant show on air, and long may it continue. Martin you have created a masterpiece! P.S. George Martin, if you are reading this, please do not kill of Tyrion, Jamie, Ayra or Danaerys please. You have ruined me!!! https://rwh92.wordpress.com/"
5,4.5,First season away from the source material continues to build on fantastic characters and story. Must see drama.
5,1.5,"It has some salvageable parts, but imagine Benioff and Weiss writing lines like ""You want a good girl but you need a bad pussy"" makes me sick."
5,4.5,Not quite on the level of past seasons but still overall lives up to the shows standards.
5,5.0,By far the best show! the part where Drogon Saves Dany just WOW!
5,3.5,"I feel very similar about this season as I do the third, a handful of awesome episodes/moments doesn't make the season a full on success, but it does keep it from being a failure."
5,4.5,This has to be one of the best fantasy drama shows of all time.
5,5.0,Go go go -- you must watch this.
5,4.5,"A couple of late elisions seem to hint at some more major characters shuffling off this mortal coil, sometimes in rather horrifying ways, but the fact that overt visual ""proof"" isn't offered may hint at some surprises in store for the show's sixth season. A few narrative stumbles and a reliance on what has become an almost impossibly overstuffed roster of characters makes this season just a tad more uneven than previous years, but perhaps that slightly askew tendency only reinforces one of the central messages of this vastly entertaining, even enthralling, show - never get too comfortable."
5,5.0,the best thing ive ever seen.... ^_^
5,4.5,"Season 5 of GOT has a few meandering politics in the beginning, as well as a quartet of unlikeable, overrated, and silly villains in Ellaria and the Sand snakes, but season 5 is another satisfying dose of Westeros. However, the final quarter of the show is very dramatic and exciting."
5,5.0,Probably the best season yet!
5,5.0,"Easily the best show on TV right now. Season 5 felt more like a plot builder than a story arc, but regardless, the magnitude of said plot developments was carried out in a way that stuns the viewer. As usual no expense was spared when it came to set location and props, which creates a genuine extravagant setting that pleases the eyes. Can't wait to see how this story plays out in season 6."
5,4.0,"Puntaje Original: 8.5 No puede presumir de ser tan genial como su predecesora, pero cielos, nos trae las escenas tanto crueles como sorprendentes hasta ahora vistas, que demuestran la capacidad de los creadores de asumir riesgos con la trama sin miedo para darnos una proeza narrativa que influenciará generaciones enteras."
5,3.0,Completely underwhelmed by most plots. But still enjoy the universe.
5,4.0,"Solid but uneven season (particularly the first half), that while delivering some of the series best moments, is a bit of a let down. It's ironic that this was the season that finally won the Emmy for Best Drama, as one could argue it's the weakest to date. A lot could be explained that this is the first season that ventured past the books, and you can tell the show runners were struggling to find a proper structure. As a result, some stories meander & are quite frustrating, particularly Daenrys & Sansa's storyline. Thankfully, the former delivered in finally uniting the series two main plots in the later half of the season. The cast is superb, with Peter Dinklage richly deserving his second Emmy (though at this point, it should have been for Lead Actor) as Tyrion, still reeling for his actions from the previous season. The new additions are solid, though the much loved Sand Sisters come off rather bland. Thankfully, the series picks up in the second half of the season, with ""Hardhome"" being one of the best of the series, while delivering one of the finest action pieces of the film (and putting ""The Walking Dead"" to shame on zombie action). Overall, not the best season, but a weak ""Game of Thrones"" is still far better than most TV, so well worth watching."
5,4.5,Cuando traicionan y matan a Jon de las Nieves estilo Jalisco :c... Pero revive al segundo capitulo :v
5,5.0,Too good of a a show.
5,2.5,"Game of Thrones has been one of the best shows on TV for 4 seasons so I suppose it had to slip up somewhere. Don't get me wrong, this is still better TV than most shows but the slip here is pretty tangible, especially when compared to that fantastic 4th season. Season 5 is slow paced, out of character, over packed and teases way too many things that don't really happen. The results aren't great, even if there are great moments."
5,5.0,Game of Thrones still proves to be the greatest thing TV has to offer.
5,0.5,Maybe after 4 it gets better? NOPE.
5,1.5,What an endless chain of blaah blaah blaah blaah. The whole story is boring too. I couldn't bear it anymore after three episodes.
5,5.0,After five seasons the show is still amazing
5,5.0,"Plot twists again (as usual), but it keeps getting better and better! Can't wait for Season 6 and see what happens next! Especially happy for Bran. I bet he's going to be a big part of the plot this season."
5,3.5,"Showing more of the white walkers and less of the copied storylines infused with sex and violence. Finally, something non-superficial that makes the show work."
5,4.0,"Not the best season of Game of Thrones is still engrossing, enthralling and fun. I can't wait for season 6."
5,4.0,"nothing like the first four seasons. if a reader, like me, of the real books it is disappointing. Definitely waiting for the sixth hoping it would be better"
5,4.5,"Few television networks have been as successful as HBO and producing Monday morning conversations up the office water cooler. Series such as The Sopranos, the Wire and Sex and the City people are glued to their television sets on Sunday evening wanting to catch the show as its broadcast rather than later on DVR the latest of these phenomenally popular shows is Game of Thrones based on the best-selling series of novels by George R. R. Martin. Preparation for the sixth season the Blu-ray and DVD releases have come out so fans can revisit the myriad of entwined characters and storylines. It is by far one of the most complicated and textured series ever and thanks to being on premium cable is able to take HBOs trademark unabashed violence and explicit sexuality to an entirely new level. Recently the author has had disagreements with the network over there limiting him to 10 episodes per season. They were somewhat material to be covered is such a staggering amount of character development to be had that every fan is staunchly behind Mr. Martin. The 10 episodes comprising the fifth season the race no time at all getting into the political intrigue and machinations that shift the status of alliance or enemy with incredible speed. This series is a unique blend of crucial warfare, sexual perversity and magic slight hints of romance sprinkled in as seasoning. Usually it is best to try to keep track of characters on your own without relying on any help from the web but due to the ponderous number of regular cast members there is no shame in referring to a Wikia if for nothing else but detailed family trees. Set upon a background of the theater society. Persons family affiliation is among the paramount driving forces in his life pre-determining the friends and foes they will encounter. In the capital city of the seven kingdoms, Kings Landing, the Ruling Family, the Lannisters are still trying to recover from recent assassinations. King, the very epitome of L'enfant Terrible was assassinated at his wedding plane falling on his uncle Tyrion Lannister (Peter Dinklage), who was falsely accused but this capital crime. During his escape Tyrion encounters his father, Tywin (Charles Dance), and commit patricide before leaving. As the season opens up his sister, Cersei (Lena Headey) is grieving not just for the loss of her son and father but how this endangers her position of power and authority. She shortly drawn by her twin brother Jamie (Nikolaj Coster-Waldau) was the incestuous father of the late Joffrey. Tyrion is one of the most interesting characters of the series who engages in one of the most exciting story arcs of the season. As a dwarf few people fear him but he is arguably one of the most intelligent people in Westeros, exceptionally cunning and a strategic genius. By bringing this pivotal character Ò the seat of power it opens the story up one of the main plot devices this season will utilize, juxtaposing principal characters and have little or no interaction previously. Tyrion is kidnapped and brought to Essos as it prized to gift for Daenerys Targaryen (Emilia Clarke). Shes been waging a campaign on the east and continent to accumulate a power base sufficient to claim the Iron Throne for herself. To accomplish this goal a lineage as the daughter of a previous King of the Seven Kingdoms provided her with almost instinctual understanding of how to gain power. Of course the fact that she has three rapidly growing fire breathing, flying dragons is a strategic advantage that few can counter. One of the most important principle themes in this season is the amount of power and influence can be wielded by religiously based cult. Back in Kings Landing Cersei has positioned her younger son Tommen (Dean-Charles Chapman) as the new king in order to consolidate their power base as married him off to the widow of the late Joffrey, Margaery Tyrell (Natalie Dormer). Religious order forms long ago, The Sparrows has a resurgence of power under their current leader, The High Sparrow (Jonathan Pryce). Males in the Baratheon family are known for their dominant feature of black hair. Both Joffrey and Tommen are fair of complexion and blonde meaning that King Robin Baratheon could not have been the father and that there was the product of Cerseis infidelity. Making matters worse it becomes evident that the boys are the result of an incestuous relationship with her brother compound these unforgivable sins in the eyes of the High Sparrow. Cersei is in prison by the religious order which ultimately needs to an extreme humiliating moment for this egotistical and power-hungry woman. Across the narrow sea Daenerys is running into her own problems. She is quite adept at talking cities and adding to her already formidable powerbase of it comes to actually governing it becomes obvious that she is overwhelmed by the myriad of details she never imagined. In her new capital city gladiatorial games but she bands them because she is against killing for sport. This and other changes shes made these to the growing dissatisfaction among her subjects. She was so sure that they would be grateful for their release from slavery that they would follow blindly but these former slaves are inundating her with demands. Aside from the dragons Daenerys main source of enforcement only group of highly trained and disciplined troops referred to as the Unsullied. They are trained from their youth to obey their owners without question and without hesitation. Despite being castrated some of their number takes advantage of the services of local prostitutes. The Sons of the Harpy, a militant religious group posted accordion laws among the people including the Unsullied. Although the Unsullied regard as the most formidable warriors ever cult members isolate individuals and overwhelm them stabbing them to death. Daenerys has had to keep her dragons chained in a cave because they have been decimating the local livestock in one case incinerated a child. She has discovered that there is a large difference between conquering and ruling. Other characters are also having extremely difficult times with John Snow (Kit Harington) being made the Lord Commander of the guardians of the wall, a huge sheet of ice that protects Westeros from the supernatural evil that works of the, The White Walkers. Fundamentally they are giant zombies that are extremely difficult to kill and capable turning their victims into one of their own. Jons two half-sisters are also in dire straits. Sansa Stark (Sophie Turner) managed to avoid being married to the cruel and vindictive Joffrey only to find herself married to Ramsay Bolton (Iwan Rheon). Just a preferred psychological torture to exert his control but with Ramsay as a husband Sansa finds itself dominated by a vicious sadist who enjoys torturing people including flaying them alive. On their wedding night he rapes and sodomizes is her forcing a childhood friend of hers to look on. Her younger sister, Arya Stark (Maisie Williams) has been trying to avoid capture by traveling the land with the henchmen known as the Hound (Rory McCann), although she is bailing in her teens Arya is consumed by revenge and recites a list of those she wants to kill each night before sleep. A father did have her trained by an expert swordsman so she does know how to handle so for the fight. This is taken to a new level which he joins a society assassins known as the Black And White. By the end of the last episode the fate of almost every major character is left undetermined making the start of season six of the most anticipated events in popular culture."
5,4.5,"Now an April staple, terrific show. Tyrion's character is the life of the show."
5,5.0,"The storytelling and character development are as well-constructed as ever, with a slow-building set-up in the first few episodes that pay off phenomenally in the last half of the season, but the greatest achievement with this set of episodes is in reaching the absolute height of purely cinematic production value and visual effects. I never imagined seeing a TV show that damn near achieves the visual gravitas of ""The Lord of the Rings"" films. Benioff and Weiss have now safely established what is the absolute greatest and most epic television series in history with the incomparable ""Game of Thrones"". If the last 25 minutes of the eighth episode, entitled ""Hardhome"", don't convince you of this idea, then I'm not sure you're physically capable of realizing and appreciating truly top-tier television storytelling."
5,4.5,"Game of Thrones is well and truly back! It's got the shocking deaths that you never expect to see and you keep saying to yourself ""Well if they're gone then anybody can go"" and if you're saying that then you are certainly right. The series takes a step away from the books for the first time and it refreshes the whole thing. People have gone from knowing everything that is going to happen to knowing absolutely nothing. That is how it should be. Bring on Season 6!"
5,4.0,"The worst season so far, but on a show this great, that's hardly an insult."
5,5.0,"Well, thing i want to say about this season is that finally winter has come! although the fact that white walkers remind me of lich king army from wow but they are well designed and really liked them. Hope to more action in season 6!"
5,4.0,The good guys definitely don't always win in the end. But I hated seeing the death of John Snow.
5,3.0,The one you can skip
5,5.0,"best series of all time,no doubt"
5,3.0,"solita girandola per Game of Thrones, con una partenza ammorbapalle che si assesta fino alla prima metà della stagione, lasciando poi spazio ad un crescendo di emozioni sempre convincente. molto apprezzabili certe variazioni sul tema, soprattutto quella che riguarda il parallelismo, da periodizzare, fra una certa cultura occidentale in passato caratterizzata da un fare retrograda ed incline all'arcaicità religiosa, contrapposta ad un'altra orientale più progredita in termini di vedute, ma non solo. permargono invece tutte quelle problematiche nella caratterizzazione dei personaggi, alcuni ridotti a macchiette e con un'evoluzione fin troppo raffazzonata. è indubbio che forse, questa volta più delle altre, Game of Thrones riesca a piazzare un cliffhanger grosso come Tyrion, in prospettiva di una sesta stagione da attendere, come al solito, con grande impazienza."
5,4.5,"Heres the great thing about this show: with a mere ten episodes per season, theres no fat. So many network shows have to stretch what should be told in 10-15 episodes into 22-24. Theres no fat in this show; everything is tight, and every episode means something. There is, of course, a lot of death, many marriages, and some very realistic battle scenes. We see many characters move further and further away, such as Arya, Tyrion, and Jaime. There is also further exploration of some of the lesser-known parts of the world, such as Dorne and Braavos, in addition to familiar locales: Meereen, The Wall, Kings Landing, and Winterfell. There is an ever-greater deviation from the books; several characters die who are still alive in the books, so everyone is equally surprised when [CHARACTER NAME] dies in the middle of [EVENT] at [LOCATION] at the hands of [DIFFERENT CHARACTER]. With such deviation, it almost resembles fan-fiction: exceedingly well-written and produced fan-fiction."
5,5.0,they always keep you guessing about who will make it through the season alive.
5,5.0,"Although Season 5 enters dangerous territory along the way, Game of Thrones still provides plenty of thrills, drama, heart, and surprises and remains a strong epic fantasy saga."
5,4.0,"Pretty great season.... Series, overall, though is getting a bit stale for me. Lots of plot lines to juggle, so the show seems to move along at a snail's pace. May be down to the way the books are structured though. I have to admit that not much happens in Dance with Dragons, and the directors have already done a pretty good job of paring down some of the extraneous plot lines."
5,2.5,"Because they departed away from the books and had to figure a way around excluding many new essential players in GOT, the pacing felt rushed. The dialogue and action felt mundane, I almost couldnt make it through an entire episode each time i began, They dwelled on uneccesary plots and characters that have no importance to the story line and also bent many of the existing lore, history and rules establishedin the previous seasons for the world and its characters ex. Ser Barristan Selmy the best fighter in all the 7 kingdoms who slice through an entire battalion and then the commander on his own, dying at the hands of 7 untrained boys with daggers. I didnt even know they departed from the books until i felt this show being so butchered I had to see what the hell was going on with it."
5,1.0,"The worst season so far, will not be coming back for s6. -A Pissed off Book Reader."
5,4.0,One of the greatest tv series of all time
5,5.0,"one of the best series I have watched ever, along with How to get away with Murder and House of Cards , has top class actors , interesting plots and unforgettable acting"
5,0.5,"say whaaat? this is the worst season of GoT, BY FAR, i love game of, but this last season made me dislike whats coming next,..."
5,5.0,Superb what a cast Maisie Williams an actress in waiting for an Oscar win
5,5.0,The gratest show ther is.
5,5.0,"Best TV series I've seen. No character is ever safe no matter how big they are to the story, this makes each episode very tense and exiting."
5,4.5,"Game of Thrones delivers a fifth season that initially struggled to present new stories and characters. In particular, the plot with Dorne was pretty loose (except the final), and fell into the boring narrative. However, the season was offset by other highlights among which Hardhome battle, which no doubt is the best we've seen throughout the series. Game of Thrones succeeds in leaving a final filled with speculation that the Internet and make the fans are very active. Although it was not his best season, it has great moments that will be remembered and appreciated for the fans. Despite these problems, the successes remain impeccable, so it reaffirms that Game of Thrones is one of the best series currently on television."
5,0.5,"A huge decline on previous seasons, this series has become insulting to the intelligent people that watch it. Unless you're really interested in tits and sleaze you'll find this show becoming increasingly difficult to watch. I dread season 6 and hope the book comes out first so I can read it without the incessant pandering to basic people."
5,5.0,A shocking season with larger than life plot twists and scenes.
5,5.0,"Winter is coming and I can't Wait! Magic, Dragons, Zombies (White Walkers), Witches, Knights, Kings, Queens, legends... What else do you want... Give me more!!"
5,5.0,"Perfect, exciting, amazing, violent, epic, intense, fun, interesting, powerful, erotic and magic. the 5th season is a masterpiece that will leave you speechless. Review en Español: Perfecta, emocionante, increíble, violenta, épica, intensa, divertida, interesante, poderosa, erótica y mágica. la 5ta temporada es una obra maestra que te dejara sin palabras."
5,5.0,"So far Game of Thrones has evolved from being a separated world (which felt like a dozen TV series in one) to a fully-immersed world of realism, violence, tragedy, and magic. Its been a grand ride so far, yet I still like the books than the show(even though it diverted from source material) the show still works into a remarkable dichotomy of intertwined fates even if Martin's grand storytelling is fading away from the show. So far in the show's history this season has been my favorite so far. Also it left a grave revelation.... Winter IS coming....."
5,4.5,"While short on narrative progression, season five of the brilliant Game of Thrones series is awash in character development and inner turmoil. The series continues to display its willingness to forsake any clean protagonists, and instead envelopes its world as the world really istreacherous, foreboding, and above allunpredictable. Instead of feeling tired or worn, the fifth season shows a remarkable fortitude and comfort level of the world buildingno story-lines or sacred and no characters are above humiliation. The acting pitch perfect, the direction crisp, and the stories mostly well conceived. Mostly- that is- because, the material has become a bit bogged down in itself, and ever-complicated. The producers rightfully anchor the series on the characters and their experiences, emotions, and trajectories which helps, but at a certain point one would hope to see more measureable progression. Winter is coming is meant with a very loose sense of urgency it seems. Still, an enveloping show in every respect, though sometimes difficult to watch, but difficult to watch for the right reasonsnotably the realist element that stands as the hallmark of the series. 4.5/5 Stars"
5,3.5,"the growing differences between book arcs and show arcs makes an ambivalent feeling: some are good, some are not (Dorne anyone), we'll see how it works in S6"
5,5.0,best series out there
5,5.0,It'll leave you hanging at the end of every episode and begging for more.
5,4.5,"It lacks the intriguing character interactions of the best seasons, but Season 5 of Game of Thrones remains one of the best shows on television thanks to great performances and unmatched production values."
5,0.5,This season the writers stop giving a damn about the books. Weakest season by far.
5,4.5,"Would have gotten five stars if I hadn't read the books (which are even better). Great show, constantly keeps you off-balance, great characters."
5,4.5,"It's a bit of a step down in quality from the seasons that preceded it, with some sub-par Sand Snakes, an abrupt and unsatisfying en to a rightful king, and an already tragic character going through even more trauma. But even then, moments like the battle of hardhome and the dance of dragons will still remain legendary, and on par with other spectacular moments from previous seasons."
5,4.0,"It's the weakest season for me, but still, it's a very enjoyable one. It starts a little slow but things start to be exciting in the last 3 episodes. And boy... when the season ends, you will be begging for more. It's a shame we have to wait another year to find out what happens next."
5,4.0,badass series badass season
5,5.0,Nothing. I repeat NOTHING is better than Game of Thrones series. I am absolutely in love and I cannot stop watching since the very beginning of season 1!!! I cannot wait until season 6.
5,4.5,"Two reasons why I love this season: 1. It's far better than it's source material. Yes, it's the only season better than the books. Season 5 is based on the most unclear books of the ASOIF series and I love how the writers of the script cope up with that. The characters who became unlikable because of the 4th and 5th book (Jon Snow, Daenerys, Tyrion) retain their likability in this season. 2. The White Walker invasion on Homeland scene is the best scene on television's history."
5,4.0,Just like Robert Arryn I wanted the little man to fly all season. Is my favorite little man a dragon rider or not?
5,2.5,Yeah this past season was just a lot of inconsistent things in it.
5,5.0,Undescribable! Epic!
5,3.5,"It would have been 5 stars until season 5 came along. episodes 1-6 of S5 were simply too boring for words. i don't mind the lack of action, but what's up with the whispering? I had my laptop volume turned all the way up and yet still found it difficult to catch what they said. whoever worked on the editing/directing/dorne scenes ought to be fired. also, what's up with the super dark lighting?? I could barely see a thing. what a waste of the millions$$$ budget. they might as well have filmed the scenes in a dark room with a candle. also, for all the people they must have auditioned, many of the new actors were surprisingly bad. to the point that i noticed it, and being the extremely unobservant person that i am, i never usually notice such things. the story twist with sansa was also illogical. request: less scenes with the dull characters please. aka the ones who never do anything. (i'm looking at you, sansa)"
5,4.0,"A season that has it's ups and downs, its intense moments and boring moments- with not much going on until the last two-three episodes, it's still delivers as one of the best shows on television."
5,5.0,"Strong performances, shocking moments, thoroughly entertaining."
5,4.5,"This season by now is the worst (but still great with 4.5/5 score) Game of Thrones season. Probably because they are adapting from the complicated-but-bland part of the book series. I still seriously love this phase of the Game of Thrones era because somehow it feels like it was better than the book. The characters become more justifiable, the plot becomes not too complex for the audience, and the White Walkers just rocks the television experience."
5,4.5,"Its extreme deviation from the books makes me feel like I am experiencing the world all over again. Show got too dark sometimes, I mean seriously."
5,5.0,Just finished season 5 and waiting for 6 . THIS TV SHOW IS THE BOMB !!
5,5.0,"Best TV show ever, enough said"
5,5.0,"if it wasnt for that southpark episode about weiners i dont think i would of watched this show, r u fucking kiding me, dont be a dink , this show makes me want to dink and get head in another time with fancy outfits , but then again who doesnt it make do that"
5,5.0,"There are no negative words for Game of Thrones. Ever! If you can see past the nudity and stop thinking its all about sex and perversions. The storyline is AMAZING. The cinematography AMAZING. The whole team, where do they find them? I have no idea. But they seem to have VIP access to the talent pool. Can I say, I'm not sorry episodes got leaked out early. My only complaint would be too few too little. More episodes in a season! Dragons, freak ass spectacular. Come on. Even after 5 seasons, I have not had a dull moment once where I thought. Hey, I'll skip this weeks episode. NO. Without fail, I have to be caught up."
5,3.0,"Still good but a significant and expected drop in quality since George R. R. Martin had to focus his attention on writing follow up books to continue the series. Should have just taken a break for a year, quality would have likely risen."
5,2.5,"Great show is marred by over the top violence including numerous scenes of torture. I guess it would be understandable if it was making some point but is otherwise light fantasy entertainment. So to see people suffering like they do on this show just wrecks it. Dont get me wrong the photography, sets, costumes and acting are very good (script ok). But torture as entertainment? no."
5,3.5,"I am a die hard Game of Thrones fan. But I am a kind of person who gives credit when credit is due. And I gave credit to season 5 only once (Which was the Hardhome episode). This season was so boring. Nothing of interest happened until 8 episodes in. Many characters and storylines are sadly put on the back burner or just badly written e.g. The Sand Snakes, Arya in Bravos, Sansa's character development from season 4 just been killed, and Stannis being ruined by D&D. Jon Snow and The Wall were the only consistently interesting part of this season takes place. While Daenerys and Tyrions story was not bad, but just boring. But I have to say, episode 8 was the best Game of Thrones episode period. Also the last episode was a strong ending with many cliff hangers which leave you desperately wanting more. But overall the main criticism of this season is that it follows generic tv tropes after no longer having the book series A Song of Ice and Fire to fall back on for inspiration. Very disapointed this time around. But hopefully next season can get back on track."
5,4.0,"The weakest season so far but it's no fault of this show since the last book was also the weakest in the series. As usual the show took a while to get going but Hardhome and The Dance of Dragons were exceptional. Previous seasons also botched certain elements but this season the disappointing, campy mess that was Dorne was just too difficult to ignore and my favourite characters, Jaime and Brienne, had almost nothing to do. Overall the changes were appropriate and actually streamlined and strengthened the narrative quite a bit. Even though it's the weakest season it's still better than any other show on TV."
5,3.5,"The realistic, bloody and beloved characteristic tv-show continues with its stunning action-sequences, unpredictable storylines and cheerful entertainment. It's especially fun to see events that began in the first season come to an end. The show got its up and downs, but this fifth installment is one of the best to date. Sure it's still an overrated show due to it's too big focus on characters and boring dialogs. But it's the one aspect that really makes the show great and beloved; I really love the characters. I might not have enjoyed the new character introductions as in the previous seasons, but it's still highly enjoyable! I can't wait for the continuation next year and I hope they can develop the story even more. My overall rating for each episode is 6.91, and even though it really is an overrated show am I giving it a 7/10. 7/10"
5,5.0,"This may be the most miserable season for the shows surviving characters yet with excellent performances, a consistently smartly written story, and visuals that can compete with many movies made for the big screen this series continues to be some of the finest programing ever produced for television. Despite its fantasy elements the show is boasts an excellent sense of realism that doesn't shy away from the dark cruel aspects of history. If you can stomach its constant deaths and horrors its a fantastic work of art"
5,5.0,Season 5 I felt it kind of slow even do was a good season Im already waiting for the 6 I hope Jon Snow survive
5,4.0,"This season 5 is like a mad pump for the next season. More dragons, bloodshed, wars and... white walkers! I bet season 6 is gonna be like a fabulous slap in the face!"
5,2.5,"Seasonal rot starts settling into a still enjoyable series. The real breaking point being the creator's odd indulgence of their leather pants wearing shirtless dual wielding infallible sadist wunderkind, which drags down scene after scene and whole plots. Some fall in love with every instance they see of this variety of Gary Stu while some of us have a limited tolerance for badly written anime. The production got an obvious increase in budget this season, and it shows as there are more large set pieces than ever before and that is the main improvement from earlier years. Unfortunately, the show is starting to feel more like an collection of moments trying to top each other than a play about character's we are supposed to be interested in. A struggle was to be expected since the two books on which this season was primarily based are mostly food porn and sight seeing, and many of the changes are improvements which keep death actually having some meaning, and as a result there are still some damned good episodes, yet clearly the show has lost a couple of steps."
5,3.5,"While it still is better than the average TV show, season 5 introduces the cracks of the show, with alot of rushed plot points, a suprisingly weak storyline for Jamie and disappearing plot elements. It doesn't destroy the great moments and the other great stories, which include some of the best and most brutal the show has ever seen."
5,2.5,Trending towards boring...
5,3.0,The weakest season in the series so far delivers only occasionally delivers the thrills amidst what feels like plainly stitched story padding.
5,1.0,"After an extremely promising first 3 seasons, the writing on the show failed catastrophically. This fifth season is riddled with plot and character discontinuities, tone deaf character arcs and big dramatic moment that weren't logically or emotionally prepared. Shamelessly shallow and amateurish is the writing and plotting of the sections on Dorne, Stannis Baratheon and the parallel rises to leadership of Dany and Jon. Weiss & Benioff are simply not ready for HBO. The ratings will stay high until the end, when people realize how badly they've been cheated on the plot and character arcs. It's just criminal what they've done to this show."
5,3.0,"Easily the weakest season. Save for some very spectacular scenes, the precise moment the writers diverted from the books is probably the same moment they diverted from having any sense, so much so that I'm not entirely sure I'm going to keep watching from this point on."
5,4.5,"This is the worst season by Game of Thrones standard. The best part is still the character interactions, but the worst aspect is the slow pace and some of the dragged out story lines. I hope they don't repeat the same mistakes in season 6."
5,2.0,"Sloppy, uneven, and downright unjust. The worst season so far, and poorly executed fodder aimed towards creating an ambiguous season finale. I feel like this season did not justify any of its ""moments."" Some unneccessarily stupid deaths that's repercussions are really not thought out for a politically charged thriller known as ""Game of Thrones."" For a show that's supposed to be about intelligent thought, some character sure act on strange impulses at times (talking about Stannis). It's bad and definitely has its lows, this show and House of Cards Season 3 definitely proved to me that the best TV can definitely succumb to lack of intrigue, creativity, and most of all genuinely just not make much sense anymore. Please, please, supposedly the source material is much better. Please take crummy liberties issuing in stuff, and completely ignoring other characters storylines in favor of badly executed shortcomings of existing focuses."
5,4.5,SHAME SHAME SHAME *ding ding ding*
5,4.5,"After a slow start, the series turn spectacular again and take the audience back. Kit Harrington raises and delivers one of the best supporting performances of the year."
5,5.0,"Once again, GOT manages to take our breath away, with heart wrenching plot twists, grotesque violence, and nudity that makes softcore porn look pg-13, season 5 continues the incredible run of success. Though some may season this season went too far in some areas, it cannot go unnoticed that each of these scenes were integral to the plot and the on going story. Many characters came, and many characters went and now we have to wait another year to see what craziness we'll encounter."
5,2.0,"9 episodes of buildup ending in a 10th ep with some decent moments, but overall a waiting game without much meat on the bone."
5,0.5,Terrible show we got here.
5,5.0,"It is amazing how this series get to surprise you even more as time goes by. It may not be the best series of all, but it's certainly the most fun. The writers achieved a superb new level this season: they had too much to explain and show, but the flow of events was close to perfection, making the mid-season catarsis nearly non-existent (and we had the best season finale since season 2. Thumbs up to two of the best episodes of the whole series ('Hardhome' and 'The Dance of Dragons'). Hands down to moralist american critics trying to create storm in a pond of water on the 'Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken' episode. My favorite season so far, from the beginning to the end."
5,4.5,Not the strongest season but still great. The last two episodes made the season.
5,4.5,The show hit a one episode slump but bounced back in brilliant style. Overall it is a fantastic show with the only downside being when you get attached to a character they are killed off. However with this comes the unpredictability of who will die next sometimes it is clear other times it is just a complete shock and for me with each season the show just gets better and better and I am looking forward to season 6 and more episodes of unpredictability.
5,5.0,"Aside from the huge criticism from fans of the books and advocates who are boycotting due to the sexual violence (which really...yell at George R.R. Martin for that) this season was eye catching, seat of the pants shock inspiring, jaw dropping and tear educing craziness. Loved characters shined; Hated characters, well were magnificent; and the White Walkers....scary bastards.... Overall awesome season!"
5,5.0,"While not as strong as season 4, I consider this show to be one of the best television shows ever made. The Dorne plot fell flat, and other places were rushed, but overall its still fantastic."
5,5.0,This season was the best season yet.
5,0.5,"This is worst season of Game of thrones series. Biggest divergence from books happen here , and show looses its spirit, sense and only gives shock factor. Two final episodes are the worst in the series. Dorne plot line horrible and also War in the north. Only some great performances manage to salvage this show and decent Hardhome episode Major fault lies in the show runners , and some directors in my opinion , not actors or original author. I cannot recommend series to anyone , just read books it is much more satisfactory."
5,2.0,"NO SPOILERS AHEAD. I cannot be the only one that thought this, but of all the GoT seasons, this one has fallen quite short of its predecessors. I'm not going to preach that ""Book is better"" bullshit, either. I've grown to enjoy the show as a completely separate entity that holds its own remarkably well, but this season got me to a point where I'd watch the episode several days after it's airing, and even then it's only because I think ""Oh right, new episode"" The season definitely had it's glimmers of hope, but not enough that they left me itching and clawing for more. My biggest peeve, my biggest peeve, is character inconsistency. Characters doing things MILES away from any reasonably spectrum to fit well with the story. This has that. And it's unfortunate."
5,3.5,"Ive had a few days to digest the fifth season finale, not that I was overly shocked, I mean they cant top The Red Wedding but I was surprised by a few things. Since last season I no longer have the books to give me an idea of whats to come so Ive experienced like most viewers did, spoiler free. First things first I really liked how Cerseis storyline evolved this season, the passive aggressive tension between Cersei and Margaery was pleasure to watch but I liked the storyline this year because for once there was a pay off. I love how all her schemes backfired but mostly I liked how we could see that she allowed herself to be vulnerable to have a chance to take back the power she had and quite possibly unleash her wrath next season. Sansa is getting more interesting as the seasons passes. This season she definitely caught my attention, she was more mature, and was playing the game a little bit but the whole time I was on the fence. I was afraid the annoying, dimwitted Sansa might pop back in at any moment. Even when the much talked about event happened to her I just couldn't care. To me, she had it coming, it was some kind of pay back for how she acted at first. And there are far worst things in this show so I dont really understand why people flipped out. Jon is finally getting confident and interesting this season, I mean his plot is moving forward in big strides and not baby steps like it used to, but with each step he made I kept waiting for the one that would be the tipping point for him. The moment that meant that he went too far. As usual Aryas storyline was intriguing but very slow, she went from the girl I couldn't wait to see, to the one whose storyline was almost boring me to tears. They really took her time with her but it really paid off at the end. Speaking about the end I couldnt review this season without mentioning the finale, the body count was so high that I was completely desensitized by the time the last death came. I was as surprised as everybody but I didnt cry, I guess I still hope that particularly death wasnt final. Most of the storylines this season were top notch, this review would be at least twice as long if I had to mention them all. Each character shined in their own way, Daenerys even had a rather impressive scene. The fifth season of Game of Thrones was as per usual gruesome, exciting, and somewhat riveting. By @wornoutspines"
5,4.0,"Even though it started off quiet slow,it picked up as we were heading towards the Finale.It had both,the best episode of the series 'Hardhome' and the worse 'Unbowed,Unbent,Unbroken'.Though overall the series still hasn't lost it's magic,thankfully."
5,3.0,"When I began watching GOT, I was dead sure that Ned Stark is the most crucial character. ?? On my contrary the very next episode got him killed. ?? Shocked me, now had to choose a different idol. So went forward for Robb and Catelyn Stark. And there it happened again! Butchered!! ?? But I still had hope left in me, that there must be someone who will emerge as the strongest in GOT. In season 5th, Daenarys Targaryen and the Lannisters are seen fighting, more struggling among themselves; one for their people's slavery + her dragons dominance and another with their internal politics. So forget about them. Well here, I was talking about Stannis Baratheon and everybodys loved one, Jon Snow. ?? I never liked Stannis much, but he sacrificing his own blood made me hate him more. After this, even I predicted that he would die soon. But DUDE! from Brienne of Tarth ?? LMAO  no further comments, this was much more than I expected GOT ?? Finally, Jon Snow, defeating and killing one of the main White Walkers made me realize that yes, he is the ONE! ?? Where White walkers appearances made few chills out of me, Jon Snow kicked many of them pretty well. Snow with his great strength, gathered much of my attention in these last two episodes. Things were started getting exciting, when something happened! Something so illogical, that it lost me. It took almost three hours to get back to my senses again. I thought, am I the only one who saw Jon Snow getting mutilated or it just really happened? The aftershocks were so high that I started thinking, that may be, Theon Greyjoy will defeat the White Walkers. No, I think, Arya Stark. No, wait, Tyrion Is 1+1=2? Or 11? ?? GOSH !! Seriously! YOU KILLED JON SNOW ? ?? P.S: What is the point any more? P.S.S: Wont expect anything from now on. It was the 5th, and the Winter is still coming.. Perfect ! ??  looking for Brain --> Error!! GOT got it killed."
5,4.5,"More brutal, more tragic, more darkness... this fifth season for HBO's insanely popular television adaptation had much to risk this season, as it publically veers from creator George R. R. Martin's original series and proceed with a script that now varies from its' source material. Still, the series prevails, not lacking in gorgeous direction or applaudable performances. It is arguably the grimmest season, featuring several unexpected events that drastically affect viewer's predictions, but HBO's behemoth delivers and once again has its' audience fully invested. The finale delivers more surprise than the infamous ""Red Wedding"" ever did, and so of course we are all impatiently waiting for Season Six."
5,3.0,"Cons- Poor Character Development on new characters (Dorne) -Story that drags on at some bits, and then speeds up - actions of some characters that go against common sense ex. (Stannis's behavior this season on acquiring the Iron throne, and then securing it with a l family lineage). Sand Snakes attitude toward their own King, their foolish form of ""revenge"" -Not enough screen time for a season with so many characters Pros -Excellent execution of a 20 minute battle scene - Problems Westeros is facing is made clear - Some excellent dialogue among old characters - some very emotional and powerful scenes (Cersei"
5,0.5,"I have been an avid follower of Game Of Thrones since it came out. Now after five seasons I sadly have to conclude that is just a terribly poor show. Won't even bother to watch the future seasons. Mr Martin has attempted to create an epic but has only achieved to create a show popular to the tastes of the masses. Murder, death and dark conceited desires to kill and maim. A let out to would be Nazi's, were they born in the right time and place. Suckering people with nudity and violence. Bravo! Each season lacks closure of any kind and after five seasons leaves one adrift in a sea of dissatisfaction. Prior to season five I would have rated this show very highly. However it is becoming abundantly clear that this is a series heading for disastrous dissatisfaction. Goodbye ol' Tyrion. You are my favourite character caught in a nightmare of a show. Goodbye..."
5,4.5,"Despite the slow beginning, as usual, the season picked up at episode eight and it broke everything with its last three episodes. The last episode is still fresh in my mind and the death of a major character, too. I will keep denying its death..."
5,4.0,"Winter has come. Well season 5 of Game of Thrones has come to a end and I'm just going to say it, this is my least favorite season. I'm not saying that it's terrible or anything like that, this is still a good season but not the best one. You may disagree with me on this one, but I haven't seen anyone saying that this they favorite season, well must of the people are saying that this is they least favorite one and they die hard fans of the show and so I'm I. These a lot of good and some flaws in this season. All the cast in the show all do fantastic as always. It's a big cast and me naming them off will take forever, but once again the biggest stand out was Tyrion Lannister played by Peter Dinklage and Jon Snow played by Kit Harington. Every since the beginning of the show they been impressing me with they outstanding performance's. Both of them are my favorite character's, until last nights episode when one of them got killed and if you seen the final episode of season 5 you will know what I mean. But anywhere all the cast did great. The best episode of season 5 and probably the whole season is the episode called Hardhome, Oh my god this episode was both intense and terrifying. The episode was nightmare worthy and freaked me out, I mean winter has came and it was scary as hell. And the episode has a scene with Tyrion and Daenery and they scene was my favorite between the two, I mean Tyrion putting some sense into her head is probably the best thing I've seen this season, because I was starting to hate Daenery a bit for everything she's done and how much of a terrible leader she is. I'm happy that Tyrion is there to tell her how you should do it. But this season has in my opinion the weakest episode in the whole season and that was Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken. I know some people hated that episode as well just because of that rape scene and I hear a lot of defending it by saying stupid things like: ""Oh these been rape, beheading, people being cut in half and being burned alive in the past season's, but this is the episode where every lose they sh*t. It's fictional, it's not real, get over it"". Okay let me just tell you this, to those who are defending the rape scene and saying get over you sound like a real ass hat for saying stupid sh*t like that, I mean get over it? rape isn't something to get over it, even it's frictional rape is still effective. Yes they was rape that happened before in the past seasons but that as well almost stopped me from watching it by watching the first episode of the first season. Now that's not the only thing why I think that episode was poor was because it was boring, dull and nothing special at all. Now overall I still think that is a good solid season, just not the best compared to the others."
5,4.5,"Despite it veering away from its source material significantly, I have come to terms with the show and am in love with its personality that it built over the years. Many tears were shed and more to come, for that alone I am happy."
5,3.0,Show is starting to feel soapy.
5,4.5,"3:) Season Finale 3:) I knew what was coming and still, along the episode I was YES YES YES YES YES NOOOOOOOOOOOO devil emoticon GREAT finally Cat of the canal, The Walk of Shame; For The Watch ... Revenge and hope ... everything!!! 3:) can't wait for either Season 6 or The Winds of Winter..."
5,5.0,"Please someone kill that stupid and simple minded mother of dragons.. Hate her very much... for Cersei, slay all that moron SPAROWS.. and for Stannis, pleaseeee don't die!!! U are the one and only true king so farrrrrr"
5,3.0,"It was a horrible episode that makes a weak season worse. Almost every character is left in a life or death cliffhanger. This episode should have been season 6 ep 1 instead. the good: Tyrion and Arya are awesome and have good stories. The OK: Dany, Jon, Sansa, Stannis and a few minor characters have good stories that are ruined by crappy pacing, lack of tension, or a poor cliffhanger. The Bad: Cliffhangers, no tension, the whole season lost depth and subtly, Margaery just disappears, King Tomen needed more screen time, Brienne was pointless and would have been better if her story was told differently - we should have seen her whole scene with Stannis and end with her noticing the light in the tower (perhaps way after the fact)"
5,4.5,"No ha sido para nada la mejor temporada, de hecho hasta la 1era mitad del capítulo 8 fue BASTANTE aburrida, pero los 2 últimos episodios y ese final que nos deja a todos en vilo recompusieron lo que se había torcido"
5,4.5,"Dark, dramatic, intense, and emotional!"
5,3.0,theres no show without john snow. not enough action in this season for me
5,1.0,Season 5???????????????? show has jumped the shark
5,5.0,"The first half of this season was kind of slow, but sure did pick up in the second half and made it all worth it. Darkest season yet."
5,4.0,"While there may have been some pacing problems in the middle episodes of Game of Throne's fifth season, it more than made up for it with epic battle sequences, and powerful drama. Wisely choosing to make more deviations from the source material this season, the writers were able to make George R. R. Martin's story work for the small screen, by decreasing its complexity. Characters were killed off that have yet to be in the books, and there were some rather shocking turns as others turned out to be quite different in personality than they were in the novels. There was also plenty of horrific scenes this season as one may expect from this show, with one particular rape scene still coming off as perhaps a step too far. All-in-all though, this series gave the show's fans another thrilling year, and perhaps its endgame is clearer now more than ever."
5,5.0,"Just about 2 episodes that weren't fantastic. Still has some problems, but episodes 8-10 just made up for everything in my mind."
5,4.5,"There are moments that are difficult to watch, but Season 5 ends up delivering spectacular action sequences and top-notch performances, resulting this season to be constantly compelling and intriguing."
5,3.5,"The most up and down of all the seasons thus far. Some things we've been waiting for five years to pay off finally do, and that's nice, but it's not the best Game of Thrones has offered up. Still a stellar show with a promising future."
5,4.0,"Great show, but season 5 has been mediocre."
5,4.5,"87% This is by far the weakest season of Game of Thrones on the whole, mostly due to it's treatment. The initial episodes are glacially slow, but the the last three episodes have enough pace to keep the whole season afloat. What is really messy here is the fact that the show runners decided to hold off all the plot twists until the very last episode, which made all the other episodes(except the 8th episode Hardhome) to be less engaging and unmemorable, however, the 10th episode Mother's Mercy is a spot on. For the first time in the show, the is actually a major change of enthusiasm and activity on the various locales of the fantasy world, for eg, ever since Tyrion left King's landing, the whole place has been nothing but a colossal bore, thanks to the horrible 4th book Feast for Crows. However, the most boring of all the storyline is that of Arya Stark's mostly because actress Maisie William's poor and predictable acting and a state where nothing really happens until the last episode. Even the arrival of the mysterious character Jaqen H'ghar can't save Arya Stark. On the contrary, the storyline of Jon Snow is the most interesting of all and that of Daenerys has also kicked some speed after a few mystery uprisal. Peter Dinklage/ Tyrion Lannister has nothing much to do in this season compared to his role in the 4th and the previous seasons. One of the most disturbing facts is that the show's special effects are really horrible, take for instance the ending scene of the 9th episode and the much hyped nude scene of Cersei where it's clearly evident in the latter that Lena Headey did not do the nude scenes herself and that her head was digitally pasted onto the double's body, all thanks to poor CGI. On the whole, assessing this season is easy, if you can bear watching 8 uneventful episodes to watch the Hardhome(8th episode) and the 10th episode of GoT to get that same feel of the show, then you will like the season just like me, or else sorry fellas."
5,4.5,"So, the most difficult season of Game of Thrones so far has ended. Difficult for many reasons. Firstly, it's adapting two dreadful convoluted books that keep on getting more and more complicated for no reason. The showrunners have done a decent job with sharpening it up to the essentials, leaving for later other stories (don't worry very angry internet fanbase, you'll get your Greyjoys...) but it also backfired more than once. Some storylines either felt too rushed or too slow. Granted, most of them have continuity with what's coming next, because this is the most carefully constructed show you have on TV right now and I don't mind certain cliffhangers or ""that's it?"" moments. They usually come back, even if it takes a couple of seasons. I'm sure when the show is done, you won't feel a season ending and another starting, it's that well built. Obviously, Dorne took the shit cake. I dunno what happened there but it seemed the story was handled to the writer's nephews or interns or something. It was just sloppy but it picked up on the last couple of episodes. I still hope they make something interesting out of this, they generally do but the drop in quality was way too evident when everything else is so great. Secondly, this is a very emotionally exhausting season. Pretty much every character is humiliated or humiliates itself in every episode. There are very few heroisms (but there are some) and everyone makes terrible terrible decisions. Some with consent and well aware of what they're getting into, others completely clueless of the downfall they're bringing to themselves. There were also a lot of parallels to parenting, on people surviving without guidance from motherly or fatherly figures, growing up on very difficult situations which gives this show an unusual depth to such a popular show. This, of course, brings rage everywhere. People confusing dreadful acts that happen on a daily basis to misogyny, child murdering, fanaticism amongst many other things, don't seem to realize that this show mirrors our society like few others do. This is not fantasy, this is something that happens everyday, are we supposed to shy aways from these topics and pretend they never happen? This was hardly ever an ""entertaining"" show right when it started, it didn't change its stripes now. Sure, I think some decisions were probably overly cruel and most violence was aimed at women this season but what about the previous ones? I saw a lot of shit happening to men on the last one, both physically and emotionally. I recall the dialogue between Oberyn and Tyrion before the trial being beyond heart wrenching. Theon being tortured was awful. But I digress, it's useless to have a decent civilized discussion online. All in all, this was the weakest Game of Thrones season so far but that doesn't mean much when you're still probably the best show around. There aren't many shows this ambitious and that manage to create such visceral emotions on the viewers. To me, that's a sign you're doing something right. You still care even if you're so enraged. That's the point."
5,4.0,"Set in a fantasy land (though, in many ways, very similar to Earth in the Middle ages) the stories of several families and individuals and their quest for power. In particular, they all want the Iron Throne... Great, epic fantasy drama, based on the books by George RR Martin. Though focusing on several individuals, it contains clever interlocking story lines, weaving family feuds, power trips and pure greed and malice. Superb cinematography, settings and scenery. Performances are spot- on too. On the negative side, there are possibly too many stories being told simultaneously. Too many characters in the story I don't care about. This particularly so in Seasons 3 and 4. Characters, often heroes and seemingly there for the long haul, get killed off in the blink of an eye, and out of the blue. This is good and bad. Good in that it shows that, as in life, there are no certainties and ""heroes"" / very likable characters with depth aren't necessarily immortal (this is definitely not Disney!). On the other hand, it leaves you feeling distant and unengaged. It's difficult to support a character when they could be killed off at any moment. Also, too many plot twists and gruesome killings, just for shock value. Not that I have an issue with watching killings, they just seem gratuitous and over-indulgent at times. While the plot is good and the characters have depth, it isn't all substance - style plays its part and sometimes the dial is too much over to the style side."
5,4.5,"While Game of Thrones season 5 suffered some minor injuries with divergence from the book, other ventures worked out well."
5,0.5,Such bull shit killing off our heros. enough we need someone to rally behind!!!!!
5,4.5,Season five added some well needed threats into the mix to truly give the feeling of hopelessness to everyone's favourite heroes. Incredible action sequences and fight scenes. It's just a shame that the story was spread over so many geographical areas that it was hard to keep up with the politics over the whole of G.R.R.M's fantasy world.
5,4.5,"This show has gotten better with each season, until now. Season 5 marks a step down from the monumental Season 4, while still being as engaging as ever. This season's main problem was that it was unfocused. There was so much to follow that it felt jumbled at times. When the season ended, it felt like barely anything was accomplished. The characters stay as interesting as ever. Certain storylines were drawn out, and there wasn't anything truly memorable until the final three episodes. This season produced a few of the best episodes the show has had to date: Hardhome, which left me speechless; The Dance of Dragons, which was another successful ""9th episode""; and Mother's Mercy, which had one of the most heartbreaking endings in recent memory. I don't know where Season 6 will go, but I am excited. I just hope they focus up and don't lose their momentum. Season 5 is a step down, but not enough to lose me. I'm still fully engaged, but with the loss of one of the show's greatest characters, it will be harder to stay invested. 9.25/10"
5,5.0,"Totally intelligent writing, and gripping"
5,5.0,Next year on #GameofThrones: Every character is dead. The writers start killing viewers at home.
5,4.5,"The fifth season of George R.R. Martin's acclaimed series of novels reaches even more treacherous and heart-sinking roads. Game of Thrones Season 5 may have somewhat of a slow start but its sheer drama, blood-drenching violence and nerve-racking cliffhangers propels it to the heights we are accustomed to and keeps us begging and pleading for more. 4.5/5"
5,4.5,"Now starting to pass the books, Season 5 was a great entry in the series. While some storylines, particularly the Dorne storyline fell flat, others that had been dormant for a few years finally picked up. I already wish it was March/April 2016."
5,2.5,I don't really like that much!!! the only thing that make me stay watching this serial is only because of the boobies!!!!!
5,4.5,"The slowest season of the show by far. It gave us one of the best episodes of the show, by far, as well. The show became dark and full of changes, more than in any other season. And even when the last episode remains, I cannot stop thinking about what the season 6 will be and how it'll be developed without the books."
5,4.0,"The season started slow with many boring episodes, but towards the second half they recovered pretty well, with Hardhome and Dance of Dragons being really amazing episodes."
5,4.5,"slow start to the season, but then explodes to a masterpiece"
5,5.0,"Addictingly good. The best when it comes to medieval, magical adventure. Good acting and excellent storylines and cool action. Also opportunities to get deep understanding of characters."
5,5.0,Quality entertainment!
5,4.0,"I loved the original pace of the story. It seems to come to a crawl. Ordinal great characters came , went , and new ones appeared. Now, it seems like they want to keep everyone."
5,4.0,"I've been a fanatic since I discovered the show, despite thinking the first twenty minutes were boring as hell. I binge watched the first four seasons then had to wait a year for this new season... and yet, I find it so... lacking? I'm still a fan and will see it through to the end, but surely I'm not alone in thinking that something is definitely missing from this new season?"
5,3.5,"They shall really start to find new ways to impress me... these ""sudden"" and ""unexpected"" deaths getting less and less effectice to my ""wow factor"". Well, almost contraproductive and putting me into a status of ""I am not that interested in the next season anyomore"", partially. C'mon guys! This is a vast fantasy world. There are far more interesting stories to tell than getting out boring episodes till the final one, compress some death/kill action into one episode at the end. Be more creative! :)"
5,5.0,"Even though at the begining the season turned to be too sentimental to my taste, there were some interesting twists, now and then, like Jon Snow turning into the Lord Commandant, the three daughters of Oberyn, Samsa acepting to marry Bolton, Stannis to decide to kill her daughter, Cersei imprissoned in a backfire, just to mention some. But, I have to admit that an episode of my top delight by far is the eigth one: Everything gets untangled at once: the rise of Tyrion, him getting along with Dænerys, Arya and her first face, Samsa finding her brothers alive, and of course, the unexpected battle at Hardhome and it's final outcome. An episode worth to watch again and again."
5,5.0,One of the best fantasy-drama fusion series i've ever seen.
5,5.0,A series that is not afraid to kill its characters.
5,2.0,"The season feels like its dragging itself. The story line is not good as compared to the previous seasons (dialogues are pathetic). Acting as always is perfect. The bottom line is, this season lacks the punch (overall)."

5,5.0,i have watched this show on my favorit mo0viesite called www.primewire.ag the best site ever.and the show also i love it.
5,4.0,A slow burning season that pays off in the final two episodes with some of the most excruciating and shocking moments in the series.
5,2.5,"Spoilers! What's up with all of the huge deviations from the book? Completely understandable that books are ""adapted"" to television series. What appears to be happening this season is a nearly complete re-writing of the story. I can understand a few tweaks her and their to time compress, and adjust the story to a television medium. That makes sense. What doesn't make sense is changing major plot points from the book, that are masterfully well conceived and portrayed, and replacing them with second rate re-writes that aren't nearly as interesting and compelling. Why take an awesome story, gut out all of the scenes that make it awesome, and then put a watered down lessor version? Examples: 1. Sansa is not marrying Ramsey Bolton. He's marrying an imposter named Jane Poole, disguised as Arya, in an attempt to secure the North. (Pretty Interesting huh? 2. Brienne is basically beaten within an inch of her life, and taken to a cave where she discover Caitlyn Stark, is a walking dead. They might still show this, but the timeline point is hugely off. (Pretty interesting huh?) 3. Jaimie and Bronn don't got to Dorne! I understand that they're putting stuff in the new series that will appear in future books, bet again where the story stands he's supposed be with Brienne right now. 4. What about Tyrion meeting John Conington who used to be the Mad Kings hand, and Raegher's infant sun, who was the heir to throne. Might want to show these people huh? They may insert them in later, but in the storyline they're already hooked up, and we're missing a chance to meet these key characters. A few examples. Don't want to turn this into a top 20 list, and don't even want to get started on what's going on at the wall or Daenerys. Not really certain why they're calling this season Game of Thrones this season. I think Game of Awful Re-Writes, would be a more accurate title."
5,1.0,???????????? ?????????????????????? ???????? 5 ???...
5,5.0,"While some may complain that this season has deviated from the books, ""Game of Thrones"" still ranks among the best shows currently airing."
5,0.5,"This show is going downhill - the writers are going for ""shock value"" rather than sticking to storylines that engaged readers in the books. They are cutting interesting and important plot points in favour of abusing women, prosecuting homosexuals, and creating unnecessary drama. The number of characters they've killed who still live on in the books is ridiculous; they're killing for the sake of killing. It does not add to the plot and just makes for a shitty, forced writing style. If they were trying to create a story that appeals to both prior fans and new fans alike, they have amazingly failed."
5,3.0,Good but disappointing in comparison with last series. Not a lot going on and no really interesting/shocking plot developments.
5,4.5,One of the most never ending curosity
5,5.0,Game of Thrones is amazing!
5,2.5,"After a near-perfect season 4, Game of Thrones has thrown all of HBO's money at bigger set pieces, but forgotten to inject any sort of life into them. The writing is considerably worse, the acting by all of the newcomers belongs in a sitcom, and most of the action scenes lack any sort of emotional weight."
5,4.0,"I remember being so confused in the beginning. All the names confused me so. I didnt know who was who 'til season four. Oh wait, I still struggle a bit so I guess I will never know. Despite this I enjoy the show. I am no hysterical GoT fan with an iron throne at home, but I like it. I do think I want to read the books as well."
5,4.0,chek out my review also http://gameofthronesseason5episode6.com
5,0.5,"lost interest after death of major character in season 4, episode 2..show's lost its appeal to me; think i'll see if i can read Martin's books instead..."
5,4.0,"Game of Thrones season 5 seems like the creators and showrunners hit the refresh button. While the stakes don't necasarily seem high approaching the halfway point, I feel like the show is going in interesting directions and straying away from the books."
5,1.5,"Great story line, great cast, really let down by marketing, adverts, hassle being able to view the show, the cost of actually watching a show and the ""corporate feel."" Lost it's authenticity. There is more plot content shown in the into and next week preview than the episode itself."
5,3.0,yet to get a push on ...
5,5.0,I really like how the women seem to be really leading the pack in this new season...brava! SPOILER ALERT: Episode 8 has some spectacular visual effects as it really grabs hold of its fantasy/horror roots and tears them out at their bloody follicles. It's a really exciting and terrifying episode. Episode 10...the season finale...just made me sad. Lots of revenge awaits in the next season!
5,4.0,"Peter Dinklage makes the show, I wouldn't be watching it otherwise."
5,5.0,"Just when you think it can't get any better, it does."
5,4.0,"The show starts to spread its wings, just like the books did and sadly the bag is a little mixed."
5,5.0,So Far The best show ever. So good its addicting.
5,5.0,The best TV series ever. Love this show and never miss an episode.
5,4.5,Love the show but would like to see some of the stories to connect soon.
5,5.0,"If I could give it 6 stars I would, one of my all time favorite shows!"
5,5.0,"It's hard to rate any season of this show anything less than five stars. This show is thrilling, gory, funny, exciting, pensive, miraculous, and awe inspiring. It is the only show that makes me want the weekend to culminate asap, just so that another episode would be released. When the reason ends, I can't bear the thought of knowing that I have to wait 42 weeks, just for another 10 weeks of GoT entertainment. Watching Game of Thrones is like being in a dream I wish I never had to wake up from. While I was a little disappointed that we did not get to see Bran stark the whole season, and even though the first half of the season was a little slow, the last few episodes of each season are always filled with so many surprised that they more than compensate for any built-up disappointment one could have had. Daenerys Targaryen is beginning to show a little weakness as she loses the loyalty of her people, her dragons, and begins to question both herself and those around her. Arya Stark is doing her own thing turning into a silent assassin. Royalty proves to have a chink in the armor. Tyrion is still alive and thinking. The night's watch can't keep their shit together. But most importantly, winter is coming!"
5,2.5,Directors forgot to read the source materials here.
5,5.0,"The show is fantastic. It looks fantastic, the acting and direction and costume and production design....etc... everything about this show is fantastic. As a Book reader, I have my criticisms and it's difficult to see the show through the lens of a person who hasn't read the books, because I have and I'm a huge ASOIAF fangirl, but I also have a film background and I understand the challenges the show runners have to make this as good as the books and they do a pretty darn good job with the restrictions they have. I enjoy both separately now. So, yes, S05e01 was as good as it can get for the show, I think...even if there was a lot of ""filler"" stuff which I presume is set-up for what's to come and what's to come, as promised, is evidently quite different from the books. It is known."
5,5.0,The best show on tv right now!
5,5.0,Amazing show with amazing characters and plot!
5,4.0,"Season 5 offers more original plots than the ordinary, which most plots turned out to be fine. A few controversial episodes which I need not name them might put off some viewers, but for fans who understand D&D's perspective, this season proves to be one of the climax-building season, probably paving its way for Season 6 and The Winds of Winter."
5,4.5,"I love this show, the storyline, the clothes, the hair (men and women), and locations."
5,2.0,"Season 5 is simply a real disappointment. Not good GoT, the directing feels labour some and unambitious."
5,5.0,Amazing first episode!
5,5.0,An ruthless TV-show that exceeds Hollywood expectations. Beware that things won't be looking so bright for your favourite characters.
5,5.0,This show still has it. Amazing!
5,5.0,GoT is as strong as ever if not even stronger. Perfection.
5,5.0,"Many shows are starting to run out of gas by Season 5, but Game of Thrones is consistently strong and superbly remarkable as it ever was as it is meticulously plotted since the first season, everything was laid out from king to pawns. It is about to go off book, and for viewers, this could be the most exciting, nerve-wracking season ever."
5,5.0,"As always, Game of Thrones never disappoints. The last two seasons have massively deviated from the books in some storylines but in a good way. The show never fails to surprise both show waters as well as the book readers in this aspect. I am obsessed and I simply can't get enough."
5,5.0,I love this show so much. A TV masterpiece. Hope the season 5 doesn't disappoint me and I think it won't.
5,5.0,ONLY HOLYSHIT CAN DESCRIBE IT

5,5.0,"Possibly the greatest TV show of all time. Incredible cinematography, acting, and writing. The only down-side is the long time in between seasons. The first episode lay the framewoark and builds slow, then hang on for a wild ride that amazes at every turn."
5,5.0,"Perfecta, emocionante, increíble, violenta, épica, intensa, divertida, interesante, poderosa, erótica y mágica. la 5ta temporada es una obra maestra que te dejara sin palabras."
5,5.0,Every episode has something exciting. Definitely something you could sit and watch for hours. Every season is phenomenal.
5,4.5,"Seasons 1 & 2 feel a bit slow, but by the end of season 3 you can't wait to see more. NOW!"
5,3.5,"Playing with a Shrinking Deck Don't get too attached to any character. Inevitably, abruptly, and mercilessly they will be mangled, quartered, crucified, maimed, dismembered, have their throats slit open, or their heads sliced off. The winning combination of brutality and flesh is enough to give Saint Francis a psychotic hard-on. The fourth season should prove to be more merciful since there are barely enough Starks left to butcher and behead. Although the dim twin and the imp's wife may be expendable enough for the show's reliable surge of gore and pathos. Set in hybrid post-apocalyptic/medieval realm, and armed with a sword and a club to sever and crush any vital signs of humanity, unpredictability is the Thrones' greatest weapon, but one which may ultimately turn against itself. After three stormy seasons, there is little left to ravage and plunder, it's too late to inseminate or introduce any newborn characters, and it will be forced to preserve the surviving tenants. Or, to coin a more familiar cliché, the baby's drying up, and there's very little bathwater to throw out. Furtherless, I can't imagine there are many horrors left to shock us with. So what's next? I haven't introduced myself to the literature or the Cliff notes, but it's fairly certain now that the bastard Stark and his half-sis li'l Xena will carry on to exact vengeance. And if the Game can no longer run rampant or rip completely rogue, it will need to go comprehensively metaphysical on us. Perhaps Father Stark will return as an ice-zombie who freezes the wings off dragons."
5,5.0,"Fantastically done. Great character development, I love the relationships that evolve throughout. Scenery is breathtaking special effects are superb. The only down side is the soft core porn sprinkled throughout, limits the people I can share this with, although I do agree with Retta ""everyone on that show can get it"". Every actor portrays their role remarkably. As one who is always looking for faults in plot lines, poor acting I can honestly not complain. And if you find a fault in the story,......wait for it....... ;)"
5,5.0,The best TV series ever! Just amazing.
5,4.5,"Most consistently good show on tv, save Mad Men and The Good Wife..."
6,4.0,"Excellent season with some major events and plot development. It is not so surprising or mind-blowing as earlier seasons and is becoming a bit less ""smart"" at times, though, still prime and peak TV nonetheless."
6,5.0,Best season for this masterpiece show.
6,0.5,Sucked. Saw every season up to this one. I couldn't keep watching it. Trash.
6,5.0,"Ao abordar temas adultos, moralidade cinzenta e consequências realistas, ""Game of Thrones"" ajudou a remodelar a maneira como a fantasia é percebida pelo público em geral."
6,5.0,"This Season starts off with a bang, and continues to be a hit throughout the entire season"
6,5.0,Melhor série do mundo!
6,3.5,"Nice, decent story, recommend to watch"
6,5.0,This season is great work a lot on the characters and especially on Arya stark
6,5.0,Season 6 of Game of Thrones ratchets up the tension in spectacular fashion. Episode 9 in particular was absolutely incredible. The battle between the Starks and Ramsey was executed perfectly with tons of bloody action that is what is expected at this point from Game of Thrones. The finale was also really good and ends leaving me excited for more!
6,5.0,"A must see for the first 1-6 seasons, its a shame how 7-8 went"
6,5.0,"One myfavorite seasons of game of thrones the first four seasons and season 6 are ny completely my favorites! And ny favorite episodes from this show is baelor,blackwater,the rains of castamere,the children,hardhome,the battle of the bastards and the winds of winter this series is the best and getting old but game of thrones will remain as one of the best shows of the history of television!"
6,5.0,"This season was just epic, brilliant show."
6,3.0,Writing : 6/10 Acting : 8/10 Cinematography : 8/10 Costume design : 9/10 Set design : 9/10 CGI Effects 9/10 Artistic vision 6/10 Adaptation ranking : 5/10
6,4.5,"Loses a half star because the storyline of the high sparrow is terrible. It just doesn't make sense that he would have so much power, to the point that the king is powerless against him. Otherwise the show is still brilliant."
6,5.0,"Best character developments, action, bloody battles! Had such a great build-up. Probably one of my favorite season so far."
6,5.0,Show reached its peak by the seasons end!
6,5.0,"The conclusion of season 6 makes this a perfect ""Game of Thrones"" series"
6,5.0,"Probably the best of the 8 seasons of Game of Thrones. The story was rich, building, inviting, and suspenseful. Production remains powerful and it was simply a pleasure to watch this 6th addition."
6,4.5,"It's okay, but some things doesn't make sense."
6,4.0,"Bloody and captivating as always, Game of Thrones plunges back into the midst of a world touched by grief, dread, and precarious sexuality."
6,5.0,Probably my favourite season of Game of Thrones. It pays off a lot of arcs and has some truly genius storytelling!
6,4.0,"A great watch, however a few moments that were a bit anoying such as jons mega super insanly strong plot armour in the battle of the bastards as well as the mountin of people that got made in less than 30 seconds. Others than these kinda of things Im nit picking its amazing!"
6,5.0,"One of the best seasons of GOT imo so far, Season 6 not only has an expertly paced narrative filled with tons of goodies, but is also masterfully acted and brilliantly directed with mind blowing action (and gore), spectacular visuals and character arcs that feels ever-so more satisfying as you reach the end"
6,5.0,"Must watch this was for me the last best season of GOT, this one was very strong for whats to come..."
6,5.0,A truly epic season!
6,3.0,Writing has clearly diminished and some of the characters stories have become boring.
6,3.0,"Much like S5, S6 is mediocre, with far worse writing than the early seasons, and the character are losing their depth, grit, authenticity. There are a couple great moments in S6, which are glaringly obvious that they were taken from Martin's notes—like gleaming diamonds amidst piles of muck."
6,3.0,"Here we are, in the downfall of the Game of Thrones TV Series: the writers basically have run out of books and therefore try to come up with an original story of their own. And well... they fail. There are still some interesting ideas and plot lines in this season, as well as breathtaking visuals, but all in all, the writing falls flat for me. This becomes especially obvious in the last episode, where the writers clearly became tired of dealing with all the different characters and plotlines, so they decided to make their job a lot easier. This season is still good entertainment, but can by no means compare to the earlier seasons. Overall it was ok."
6,4.5,Almost as awesome as the first four seasons.
6,4.0,Not the best season of GoT but it was solid and built a solid footprint for a great ending.
6,5.0,great show from great books
6,3.0,"Season 6 presents the true threat to the overall narrative in an incredible and terrifying way. You begin to understand, in a way you weren't able to previously, what truly is at stake in the story. Sadly, now is when the utter lack of enthusiasm and appreciation that the show runners had for the show fully begin to present. A continual escalation is delivered, however it comes at the expense of developing others storylines, leaving several main and beloved characters feeling hollow, and non paramount. Whether it was a true inevitability with the source material or not, we'll never know, because the show runners at this point decided for us that a significant amount of story lines & characters were no longer relevant, and it feels like nothing more than the beginning of a saddening and grueling end."
6,5.0,"Few series quite as perfect as this one. Just one thing,,,,did winter ever really come?"
6,5.0,Absolutely brilliant loved it the mix of medieval theme and fantasy and white walkers horror it's brilliant and love it and the battle Sean's are amazing and brings the horror of battle to life like I've never seen before on a historical battlefields and dialogue all great
6,0.5,People pretend to like this because it makes them feel smart... There's a reason I don't go to to my Condominium Meetings... they're boring... but the people that pretend to like this show truly want to go to those things because they want to feel superior to any normal person with normal tastes... smug fucks.
6,5.0,One of the best season!!!!
6,5.0,Dialogue lacks from seasons 1-4 but this is also GoT at the peak of its powers.
6,4.0,"Season six is certainly a step up from a middling season five but still pales in comparison to earlier seasons, even if the final two episodes are among the series' best."
6,5.0,este show se sumerge en un mundo ambicioso y fantastico
6,4.0,"I was lucky to watch the entire series of Breaking Bad over a periof of a month or so, and was reminded of how much better that is than these year-long breaks where you try to remember why you cared. I'm almost starting to root for the White Walkers and give this four stars because I would hate to be the one to dissuade them from finishing the damn series."
6,5.0,Amazing. Best tv show of all time.
6,4.5,My rating for the s6 is a 9.2/10
6,5.0,My favorite season of any show ever. Truly a masterpiece in storytelling and visual effects. I can't think of a single story moment I hated that I wasn't meant to. Loved every minute of it.
6,4.5,The Battle of the Bastards alone raised the season by a star.
6,5.0,Episodes 9 and 10 are perfect. This is GOT.
6,5.0,"One of the best seasons of GOT imo so far, Season 6 not only has an expertly paced narrative filled with tons of goodies, but is also masterfully acted and brilliantly directed with mind blowing action (and gore), spectacular visuals and character arcs that feels ever-so more satisfying as you reach the end."
6,4.5,Love the character development (especilly Arya´s) and you are told nothing before it is necessary. Love the show
6,5.0,"Essa sexta temporada conseguiu ser muito boa, principalmente com o episódio Battle of the Bastards, tendo um ótima fotografia e sem contar que tem muita violência e sangue, que deixa ainda melhor."
6,5.0,Amazing season with a final 2 Episode epic knockout punch television has never been that good and likely never will again
6,5.0,esta temporada es sangrienta y cautivadora
6,3.5,"Still good, but the farther away the showrunners took this from the original source material, the less sense things made - often enough it was just dumb jokes and thick plot armour."
6,4.5,"Very, very good but not perfect, like many other seasons. The climactic finishes are better than in season 5, but not as polished as in season 4. A lot of the characters get put to the side for others that aren't as interesting. With that said, this is still a very good season and sets up season 7 well."
6,4.0,"Great season, but it lacked a bit of good dialogues...also more stereotypical and cliché-like than the first 4 seasons"
6,3.5,"Incredible show, at least till it follows the books. After it surpasses the books, problems start. Last season is best not mentioned."
6,5.0,Unquestionably my favorite season of GOT.
6,5.0,I hate kings since this season.
6,5.0,"Great finale, made me want to watch more"
6,5.0,Best season of the entire series.
6,4.5,"In many ways the most impressive season from a meta-standpoint. The overall quality is much improved since the last season and the strongest scenes are some of the show's best. While some scenes can't compete with the high writing quality of the books, the strong writing overall is very impressive for being almost entirely past its source material. The overall production quality is higher than ever, and the two final episodes stand out for amazing directing."
6,5.0,"Season 6 was awesome and it's also where GoT for me ends because season 7 and 8 were just horrible (lazy writing, rushed ending, many things didn't make sense, all character developments were thrown out of the window,..)"
6,4.5,"While the majority of the season had rather dull plot lines, its climax points (finale) achieved exceptional highs."
6,4.5,"Aside from a couple questionable plot elements here and there, this is Game Of Thrones at its most focused. Much like the second season, it successfully improves and advances all the plot threads from the previous season."
6,5.0,"This season has one of the finest battle sequence, Well directed, CGI was great. Battle of Bastards was delightful."
6,5.0,"Melhor temporada de GOT, o episódio 9 é um dos melhores que já vi em minha vida, a batalha dos bastardos, a destruição do septo, momentos inesquecíveis."
6,5.0,"One of the best seasons in the series by far. The finale battle is one of the best in the show in my opinion, and has some of the best conclusions of arcs in the show."
6,3.5,"The sixth season loosely follows the fourth and fifth books with some major changes here and there. Good season with memorable characters and episodes. Another step back in the series. They could've used the source materials more, but the end result is still entertaining although worrying."
6,5.0,The sixth season continues to keep the quality of the previous seasons and keeps the level of the show as one of the best ever made.
6,5.0,Pretty awesome show man
6,4.5,"Fue la temporada que más disfruté, las peleas me encantaron y tuvo un final esperanzador. Lástima que lo tiraron todo por la borda en las últimas temporadas."
6,5.0,"A primeira metade da sexta temporada de Game of Thrones ainda trazia deficiências de seu ano anterior. A situação ficou melhor quando a história recuperou fôlego e ritmo, culminando na fenomenal Batalha dos Bastardos, que engatou 3 episódios fortes logo em sequência. Mas, novamente, nota-se que David Benioff e D.B. Weiss têm certa dificuldade em navegar sem os livros de George R.R. Martin como apoio. E a quinta melhor temporada de Game of Thrones!"
6,1.5,it was a nice show at the beginning... gone bad already
6,5.0,Television sure does have a lot to live up to after this.
6,5.0,Best. Season. Ever (until now).
6,5.0,"I LOVE Season 6. Margaery dies in the finale, Cersei becomes queen in the finale of season 6 or some time in the start of season 7, and there's just so much action it's a great season."
6,5.0,"The best show ever by far, and for me it's the best season so far, it's just spectacular !!!"
6,5.0,Masterpiece. It contains one of the best episodes of all times: Battle of Bastards.
6,2.5,"As soon as they departed from the books, it all started to go downhill."
6,0.5,Go read the books instead.
6,5.0,Game of Thrones Season 6 | Detailed note: 9.6
6,0.5,Most overrated show of all time I was waiting for some character or even just some welly filmed action but never got either in all of these seasons
6,5.0,"best season in the series by far. however, it lead the franchise down a path it will never truly recover from"
6,5.0,Battle of the Bastards is the most thrilling on screen (whether in a movie or TV show) war that I have ever seen. Ramsay Bolton is such a despised villain that there is a large sense of satisfaction when Sansa kills him in the most fitting way.
6,5.0,Perfect season of all seasons. Because it will be a delightful for all daenary's fans but not for jon snow's fans.
6,5.0,"The peak of the show, battle of the bastards and winds of winter... Amazing"
6,5.0,"Even if u hated the ending this is by far the greatest show of all time. Each episode keeps u on the edge of your seat. Never have i ever heard as many people talk about whats gunna happen next week. There was just a lot of people upset because they didn't get what they want but that is what the whole show was, you never got what u want."
6,5.0,"Game of Thrones Season 6 is by far the best in the series. With great performances and intense writing, the series makes a super satisfying end and bring us to the stage where the series jumps off the references of the George R.R Martin's Novel. KING IN THE NORTH and WINTER IS HERE!"
6,3.5,Comienza a resentirse la falta de material en la cual basarse pero todavía logra un nivel de calidad bastante aceptable.
6,5.0,greatest season ever in the tv history!literally after each 2 episode my mind was like i cant bare how its not considerd as 8th wonder literally speechless!
6,5.0,Exquisitely crafted to near perfection for a season of a television series. This is an intellectually rare and riveting achievement to behold. 10/10
6,5.0,"Great as always by the Actors, Directors, Writers etc. and all the Department's in general."
6,3.5,"The battle of bastards was gem in the dirt of the season that was 6th, the incompetence of the creators began showing when they no longer had GRRM material backing them up. Baring a few technically brilliant episodes/shots most of the season didn't take the story forward but catered to the demands of the audience for cheap highs."
6,4.5,"This season has the only moment I ever cried in while watching this. It had great writing, Tyrion was starting to go downfall for me here as he's no longer really doing anything. Like I enjoyed Tyrion when he did his own thing but now he's really just serving Dany. Sansa gets fucked up in this season and Theon is completely broken. Arya didn't have to be in that House of Black and White for so damn long and her story there felt a little unrealistic. Like she gets stab in the gut with the blade twisted (which would've basically killed her instantly) yet she flows down a dirty river which would've infected the cut and then survives basically unharmed and runs through the city like a maniac in no pain at all. But I'm super glad Ramsay was killed and that battle was AMAZING."
6,5.0,"best, it was really good, i enjoyed it. please give us no2 etc asap. as I WANT MORE !!!!"
6,5.0,Personally my favorite game of thrones season
6,3.0,The writing begins to fall flat as the showrunners struggle to find a direction to take the series to.
6,3.5,"The show started going in a weird direction, the visuals were as usual, amazing, but the characters started to take a back seat. For example the character Little Finger acted in a way that is not consistent with the way he was built over the past seasons. Sansa's entire story continues to be other people fixing her mess, after which she acts as if she did everything, her attitude is not consistent with the events. The whole ""the north remembers"" plot went absolutely nowhere. However the gorgeous looking action and the great acting still keep it above pretty much anything else on tv"
6,3.5,The best season so far after the writers got to direct the storyline.
6,5.0,"The last actual season of Game of Thrones before things really began to go south. This was definitely the strongest season out of the final four which lacked book material. With a despicable antagonist, a refreshing union of the Starks, great political intrigue, and grand stages further solidifies Game of Thrones's position in pop culture. The last two episodes in particular is just t.v. at it's best; featuring my favorite battle sequence and favorite episode of all time respectively. When I recommend Game of Thrones to my friends, I think of seasons 1-6. I really miss these days..."
6,3.5,"Eight poor to average episodes redeemed by two absolutely brilliant ones. The penultimate episode of this season is perhaps the greatest to air on television, but lest we forget the journey to that point."
6,1.0,GOT was fantastic all the way up to but not including the end. Absolutely hated the ending. I intended to buy the entire series on 4K as soon as it was issued but the ending episode turned me off.
6,4.0,"A touch lackluster after the brilliance of the show prior. Still fun and enjoyable, however!"
6,4.5,"This season ends on a deceptively strong note. The inconsistency and pacing issues between the different storylines are still there, and the dialogue is starting to get a bit... not as good as it was when they had more of the source material, but between Battle of the Bastards and Winds of Winter this had some incredible moments of strength, a lot of it due to the actors, directors and everyone making this the best looking, best sounding show maybe ever. It almost makes up for the weaker writing entirely."
6,3.0,"This season is replete with bright moments, often stupid, but superbly made, which contrasts sharply with other moments that are filled with boredom and lack of ideas."
6,4.5,"Season 6 starts off a bit slow, but it gains momentum fast. All of the buildup leads to the two most epic season enders the show has ever seen. (A-)"
6,0.5,"The story of game of thrones is fake, wrong and family destroying. full of sad scenes like rape, killing innocent people, adult parts. all the people slept together.!!! Too bad"
6,2.5,Should have been based off of the source material.
6,5.0,A strong season - probably one of the strongest.
6,5.0,the battle of the bastards was big
6,3.5,"Still hugely entertaining with outstanding moments and acting performances. Ramin Djawadi's soundtrack continues to impress. However, the emphasis is now moving towards big set pieces, battles, etc, with characters teleporting all over Westeros so the plot can advance at breakneck speed. You get all the key points, less of what happens in between."
6,4.0,"Right I don't remember much and I just watched this like a month ago So everyone's opinions get into my head Why do people think it was just season 8 that went trash honestly I don't remember thinking too highly of this season honestly Okay they ruined Jon, what even with Arya, and honestly what did they do to Bran. So I'm rating this 4 cause half way through this series I adjusted my expectations and just started enjoying on a surface level"
6,4.5,"Blown away again by this amazing season, great plot twists, character arcs, action scenes."
6,4.5,"Stylish and bloody as ever, Season Six of Game of Thrones is building into something dark and amazing and the shows characters stories are as moving as ever. They continue to surprise and amaze with this show."
6,4.0,jon nieve resucita la batalla de los bastardo fue brutal esta temporada
6,5.0,"Really great show! It got it all, the Actors, writing and special effects."
6,5.0,Season 6 of Game of Thrones touches on shocking reveals and brutal violence with some of the most satisfying and heartbreaking drama the series has ever given.
6,3.5,Lots of deviation from the books and some awful writing in places - eg. Arya surviving several stabs to the stomach. Another dumb mistake was to show Melisandre as an old lady when not wearing her necklace - in season 4 she was in a bath without it and was still young... I could go on and on with examples but the point is that it is worse than seasons 1-4 and similarly ok to season 5 - nowhere near as bad as seasons 7 & 8.
6,4.5,"Season 6 showed that amidst the declining quality of Game of Thrones, they could still have an exciting, action-packed season. Definitely the best the series has been since season 3. Gave it a 4.5/5 because while things are intense and the increase in production capital made for some very beautiful cinematography, the season doesn't take much time to breathe."
6,5.0,Best season since season 4. Amazing how good it was considering most of the book material had not yet been written for it. The finale was the best finale of the entire series.
6,5.0,Best season of the series so far. 7 and 8 have a tough act to follow.
6,4.5,"This season has a lot of great moments, and managed to end on a very high note."
6,3.0,"They ruined Arya's character and made her completely unbelievable. The only thing that saved this season was the Battle of the Bastards, and the performance of Iwon Rheon as Ramsay Bolton."
6,4.5,"Although it's obvious that the writers are now off-book, the show still manages keep up with the previous seasons with the characters' story lines and development whilst still providing that much needed action and bloodshed. I didn't think that Hardhome could be beaten but Battle of the Bastards proved me wrong."
6,4.5,"Season five wasn't very good and season six is a mixed bag, it ranges from nothing happening at all to fast paced battles. This season is where everything starts to come together and the last two episodes are the best of game of thrones though the story about the High Sparrow overstays it's welcome (Cersei was tired of it too) and Arya's story comes to an unsatisfying close, the rest exceeds expectations and twists in ways you couldn't imagine, thought there are some missteps it's still better than most shows on TV."
6,5.0,"Brilliant. Along with Season 8, my favorite. The last two episodes were among the best in television history, with The Winds of Winter my favorite of the show."
6,3.0,Storyline for Season 6 was satisfactory. It could do better
6,4.5,Just when you though Hard-home would be its best action sequence in GOT history... well wait till you see BOTB.
6,3.0,"This is where the show began to decline. It seems as if the show is unable to maintain the books' complexity, which is understandable. However, it becomes clear that without the source material accurately adapted, the show is just not as good."
6,4.5,still awesome the battle of the bastards and winds of winter elevate this season it recovered from season 5
6,5.0,"Season 6 is just another A+ season and it just keeps getting better with each season. The acting from the lead cast was stupendous especially from Emilia Clarke, Maisie Williams, Peter Dinklage, Sophie Turner, Kit Harington, Gwendoline Christie, Iwan Rheon, Lena Headey, Nikolaj Coster-Waldau, Kristofer Hivju, Nathalie Emmanuel, Ellie Kendrick, Jonathan Pryce, and Alfie Allen. The acting from the supporting cast was terrific especially from Diana Rigg, John Bradley, Jerome Flynn, Jacob Anderson, Gemma Whelan, Bella Ramsey, Conleth Hill, Faye Marsay, Max von Sydow, Daniel Portman, Hannah Murray, Indira Varma, Carice van Houten, Michiel Huisman, Essie Davis, Jessica Henwick, and Keisha Castle-Hughes. The battles this season were remarkable and awesome especially the battle between Jon Snow, the Night's Watch, the Wildlings, the Mormont Army, and the Knights of the Vale against Ramsey Bolton and the Bolton Army and the battle between Daenerys Targaryen, Drogon, Rhaegal, Viserion, and the Dothraki against the Masters. The writing, storytelling, and plot this season was phenomenal. The visual effects were very impressive this season especially Drogon the Dragon, the Wildfire explosion in the Great Sept of Baelor, and Daenerys Targaryen walking out of the burning Dothraki shack. The makeup effects were excellent especially Leaf and all of the Children of the Forest, the Night King, the undead army of wights, Wun Wun the Giant, and Gregor ""The Mountain"" Clegane. The sets and scenery were splendid this season just like they are every season and this season especially the Cave of the Three-Eyed Raven. The music was great especially the music featured in episodes 9 and 10. The last scene was great and cool seeing Daenerys with a huge army and her three dragons by her side. Game of Thrones is still my 2nd favorite show of all time."
6,0.5,"Ending fails so bad, don't waste your time. Creators obviously didn't care, they failed big time. It's like some writers came in that didn't watch the show"
6,5.0,"My favorite season of television of all time! Every episode was excellent, but the last 2 were especially great."
6,5.0,The best season ever
6,5.0,"The final chapter is incredible, wow"
6,5.0,And I thought Season 5 was good! Wow!
6,5.0,Best Season for having the most intense big moments. The show peaked during the final two episodes.
6,4.5,A great season! The characters come full circle to make this season one of the best!
6,4.5,Dynamite! The last great season.
6,5.0,"This rich story, that has been an exciting roller coaster, is now shaped on a story no one saw coming. We finally know who the main characters are, and who everything that happened so far mattered. Complex characters, great acting, and finally dragons."
6,5.0,"Still can't get over the score of the finale. Great acting, incredibly beautiful sets, amazing production all in all. Well done!"
6,2.0,Slightly worse than previous seasons
6,4.5,"I started watching Game of Thrones during Season 6, and then went back. While it does have a few problems, they aren't that big. (Continuity and consistency issues arise in the latter half of Season 7 and 8). The plot is good, the writing was still good, and the acting is phenomenal. The film crew, stunt crew, and makeup/wardrobe people did a great job."
6,5.0,One of the best seasons ever to exist on tv
6,5.0,Best season of GOT. Simply amazing.
6,5.0,Best season to date.
6,5.0,Powerfull season! Never seen a Tv show like this! Totally something new!
6,3.5,Pretty obvious the writers and directors aren't up to handling a story without the books content. The show has lost all its complexity.
6,5.0,My #1 favorite seaon of Game of Thrones.
6,5.0,"Finally a show without those stupid Hollywoodish, PG-13 happy endings. Something serious."
6,4.0,"Some interesting plot points, but not the best. The best seasons are behind them now"
6,5.0,arya trains to become a faceless assassin. and someone who will remain nameless loses more then he was hoping to lose
6,5.0,A good season to watch of GOT.
6,5.0,This season finale is simply the best thing ever seen in TV history.
6,5.0,Best show on TV. top 3 best show of all time
6,4.5,"Game of Thrones goes bigger and dives deeper in its sixth season, offering up stunning locations, intricate stories and unmatched brutality in never before seen epic clashes."
6,5.0,The books where amazing and the show is extremely engaging!
6,5.0,"Although the unpredictability and boldness of its first seasons is considerably gone, Season 6 is as action-packed as ever and the audience gets a lot of pleasing pay-offs to cheer for."
6,5.0,"After a slightly weaker season, Game of Thrones, now ahead of its source material, creates one of its most captivating seasons yet."
6,5.0,"Story, Cast, Acting, VFX etc every is Tremendous also Most Realistically Written Series, Realism means nothing blurred or muted or cut e.g. Sex Scenes & violence Scenes which makes it different from other TV series & Amazing & Realistic... Also High Fantasy, Kings, Queen, Wars, White Walker (Snow Monsters) & Dragons Makes it Great High fantasy TV Series... To the point & Close to the Book, This TV series is Magnificent & Excellent, I Really Liked it Rated 10/10 Regards"
6,5.0,"They got awake, and hit us with the second best season of the series, season 6. This season is very epic and entertaining indeed, but it's not like season 4, because season 4 had everything under-control, but season missed the soundtrack, but stills a fascinating season though! And again -finally- they didn't need a savior! Every-episode was fighting to be the best in the season, and episode 9 won, but stills not special like S4 E9. So GoT is back again with a big hit season!"
6,3.0,"Easily containing Game of Thrones' worst narrative decisions, Season 6 is, at best, a slowburn that culminates in the best two episodes of the entire series; at worst, it's a plodding and uneven transitional season."
6,5.0,"Best show ever, the show really starts to get going in season six, heres where the show starts setting everything up for the final season that I cant wait to see in 2019."
6,4.5,He is back.. But with more characters.. Developed and Better.. Ready to take down for better good.
6,5.0,incredible season especially the last 2 episodes
6,4.0,"This is a very satisfying season that brings a little more magic and supernatural to the world as we know it. Each of these characters make a great transition over the span of this season. New stories are told and we lose people we love to see. Action, suspense and development are executed for this season."
6,4.5,"Puntaje Original: 8.5 Pocas cosas me convierten en un fanático, y Game of Thrones lo logró, así que con orgullo digo que soy un Fan de Game of Thrones. Gracias George R.R. Martin, D.B. Weiss, David Bennioff, todo el elenco, y todos los que hicieron posible esta maravilla."
6,5.0,"After a lagging fifthh season, this season had my full attention again. Every episode was better than the last and the build up to the Battle of the Bastards was fan-freaking-tastic!"
6,5.0,Best season of the best show ever.
6,5.0,La mejor temporada de Game of Thrones. Los perosnajes se transforman poco a poco y hacen que la historia avance de manera increíble. Aquí hay uno de los mejores episodios hechos para la TV.
6,4.0,Game of Thrones: Season 6 Game of Thrones once again knows how to be bold yet mesmerizing
6,3.0,Things become funservice
6,4.5,"One of the best seasons so far in my opinion. It's impressive that you can get to the sixth season of a show and it can still surprise you with revelations and events that have been set in motion since the beginning and completely break your heart. So many characters became more complex and interesting, Sansa in particular becomes a very interesting and likeable character, the finale is fantastic and the battle of the bastards may be one of the best battles on the small screen I've ever seen. There are a few parts where smaller plot arcs fall by the wayside and side characters that are important in the books don't get their due but there were so many amazing, memorable moments this season that that can be forgiven."
6,4.5,battle of the bastards was the best single episode of TV i saw all of last year .
6,4.5,"Game of Thrones may be one of my favorite TV shows to date, due to the powerful and amazing story, paired with the directors' drive through the story. In Game of Thrones, what happens, happens. We, the viewers, are at the mercy of the writers, and that pulls and tugs so many of us to real emotion. Season 6 keeps tried and true to that theme. The casting, filming, editing, and every other part of this show, all conglomerate to make a beautiful show that keeps us ready for more."
6,4.0,"had some flaws, and slow at times earlier in the season, but the last two episodes were amazing. especially the last one, one of my all time favorite episodes of any show (3 viewings)"
6,5.0,"Not as good as season 4, but still brilliant. Second best season of GoT."
6,5.0,"Somehow, this show keeps getting better and better. The budgets and set pieces keep getting bigger, but the characters remain well written and crafted."
6,5.0,Flawless season for a flawless show
6,5.0,my absolute favorite show to say im obsessed would be an understatement.
6,5.0,"Devastating, the most insane episode yet... King's Landing scenes, that beautiful revenge, that awesome Northern support, that beautiful southern city, the plot for the greatest revenge, the amazing revelation and that expected departure. A new level of EPICNESS has been defined here. Congratulations for that 10/10 on IMDB! BEST SEASON YET."
6,5.0,Another awesome season - so many storylines were paid off this season.
6,4.0,"Overall Season Rating 4 / 5 The Battle of the Bastards and The Winds of Winter Rating 5 / 5 SPOILERS AHEAD!!! To be honest, the only two episodes that need to be talked about here are the final two The Battle of the Bastards and The Winds of Winter. Both of these episodes are up there with the best episodes ever on Thrones. Up there with Red Wedding, Purple Wedding, The Mountain and the Viper and Hardhome. Both of the final two episodes of season six will be talked about by fans, critics and reddit theorists for a long time yet, and the way season seven is set up is just a scintillating prospect. The first eight episodes of season six have been steady (by Thrones standards), except for a couple of stories like Jon Snows resurrection and of course HOLD THE DOOR! But aside from them, there were episodes which appeared no more than filler and dragged out episodes with next-to-nothing actually happening. What was the purpose of the Hounds storyline other than to show he lives? His storyline added nothing to the grand scheme of things. Are we to wait till next season to see any reason for his inclusion this season? Brienne and Pod spent most of their time travelling to and from places and people, yet largely did nothing. Will they be rowing anywhere nice next season, or will it be more messenger work? Even the re-introduction of Uncle Benjens character when saving Bran, was mishandled greatly. One minute he is given a shadowy and secretive introduction, the next he is gone! Any point in him being there? The writers seem to be treading water with a lot of storylines in anticipation to the final two episodes, but many fans will forgive them for that! It is clear that the last two episodes have saved the season, and made Thrones still a heavyweight programme that is still capable of shocking and mesmerising the viewers, even after 60 episodes. The battle between the Stark and Bolton will go down in Thrones history as an episode where everybodys jaw hit the floor. And no wonder really, when the battle episode cost $10m to make, 25 days to film and the scene where Jon punches Ramsay in the face took 10 hours to film (Kit Harrington only connected with 2 punches!). Daenerys return to Meereen with her dragons to kill the Masters and the Sons of the Harpy was gripping and goosebump stuff! Which leads me on to an aspect which has become apparent this season. Women rule the world! Daenerys manourveres to take the Iron Throne, Sansas role in escaping Ramsay and to ultimately defeat him, House Mormont ruler, Margery manipulating Tommen, the women of Dorne killing their King and backing Danaerys, and of course Cersei. She had an incredible role to play in The Winds of Winter, the plot to blow up the Sept with the High Sparrow, his followers and Margery with it, which ultimately wrestled control of the Seven Kingdoms back to her and Tommen, before Tommen, who had been manipulated by Joffrey, Tywin, Cersei, Margery and the High Sparrow finally made the first and last sole decision in his lifeto take his own. Now Cersei sits on the Iron Throne, with everyone pretty pissed off with her, including Jaime judging by his reaction to her coronation. Another woman who has made this season a season of her mastering deadly skills is Arya, who is now embarking on her crusade to rid everyone from her list, one of which was Master Fray. However, despite the Shakespearean-Titus element of feeding him his own children in a meat pie and slitting his throat, the scene felt rushed and did not have the impact which they may have hoped for. Anyway, the female protagonists of this fantasy drama have well and turned up this season and Cersei, Arya and Sansa will undoubtedly play key roles in season seven. I cant say enough how much I enjoyed the final two episodes, with both episodes when the black end credits rolled down all I could see was my open eyes and mouth reflecting back at me from my laptop screen. The rip-roaring entertainment was fantastic, the spectacle of every location was spectacular and the acting from every single actor was on point. Game of Thrones has shown it has staying power and will attract even more viewers when they hear of the madness and brilliance of the final two episodes! * Side note: The Citadel is a wondrous place, and for someone who wants to work in publishing, the scene with Sam and the library was GOALS! https://rwh92.wordpress.com/"
6,4.0,"Still as enthralling as ever, GOT's 6th season has a few moments where the plot lingers, such as Daenary's Dothraki segment or Arya's training, but the quality is still high. The High Sparrow plotline grew extremely tiresome, but if you can get through that, season 6 sets up the final run very well."
6,1.0,"This series should not be placed amongst 'normal' products, but rather should be thrown in with monkey on backs. This is due to its intoxicating characteristics. Its unpredictable and lacks a clear protagonist, which makes it unique in a world that only views good vs evil. I'm truly astonished by the level of creativity. The reason why i have given it a half star is because I feel that they have done us all an injustice by neglecting to include the, ""warning could be addictive sign""."
6,5.0,I dont even like mediveal genre but this is now my favorite show by far. i cant WAIT FOR SEASON 7
6,5.0,It seems to be heading in the way of the end but leaving behind the superb acting and storyline is just not happening.
6,5.0,"I still can't believe this show is real. The acting was perfect since the beggining of the ""Winter Is Coming"" episode (first episode of the first season). The effects were awesome that make anyone think those three dragons really exists. One of the best stories I've ever seen on a show. This was a master play by HBO. I don't really want this show to end."
6,4.0,Excellent. Keep me engaged the entire season.
6,4.5,Winter has arrived! Can't wait for season 7!
6,3.0,"Horrible script mistakes, but with a notable improvement over the fifth season, with moments of the most iconic of the series and sometimes developing good plots. Still disappointing."
6,5.0,great tv show acutly the the best in the world
6,5.0,"This TV show always remains me what makes a great one, and everything is set to be in history as one of the best tv series of all time, also my favorite one"
6,4.5,"There have always been television shows to the category of water cooler hot topics. The type of show that is so controversial or just incredibly excellent that everyone is talking about it the next morning. Over a decade ago the premium cable network, HBO, started a trend that made Monday mornings focused on this Sunday evening lineup. It began with series like The Sopranos and continued with other shows such as Deadwood and Oz.' Each of these series represented extraordinary feats and acting writing and directions. Because premium cable networks are exempt from the FCC regulations on content, HBO was able to push the envelope you on anything possible on traditional broadcast television. Topics of mature nature including potentially offensive language and explicit sexual situations and nudity, based on a trend that would soon reverberate through the other upper tier cable networks. HBO has always lived up to their marketing slogan, ""It's not TV, HBO,"" by providing some of the best entertainment ever. The latest in their continuing line of must-see television series is Game of Thrones,' based on, A Song of Ice and Fire,' George R. R. Martin's series of fantasy novels. Not only has the series generated incredible ratings but the sale of the novels has rocketed to the top of the best-selling lists. Each season is only ten episodes but during that approximately, 10 hours of material fans are enthralled by the intricate tapestry of plot lines and characters. Little is what it seems on the surface. The derivation of much of the shows entertainment is trying to determine the actual motivation of the characters and how they react to the ever-changing always dire circumstances. The sixth season is now available on Blu-ray/DVD, so its time to revisit the Quest for the Iron Throne and prepare for the start of the endgame season seven. At the end of the previous season, one of the most popular characters, crucial to the overall story was brutally betrayed and assassinated, Jon Snow (Kit Harington). Spoilers are commonly a divisive subject but in this instance, the divide between those who have read the books and the enthusiasts will experience the story through the series is seriously epic. Thus far the story has reflected the novels reasonably closely with the usual caveat concerning the use of dramatic license. There are sufficient alterations in the story made to accommodate the differences in the presentation to keep even the most knowledgeable fan guessing. No matter which camp you are in one thing is assured, Jon Snow would have to live again. The story set in a world where magic exists. The entire series is planned meticulously, details placed in play long before their actual importance becomes germane to the narrative. One example is Melisandre (Carice van Houten), the Red Witch. As a Priestess of the Lord of Light, she is an expert practitioner of the mystical arts. She has made prophecies concerning the upcoming long winter and night would be full of terrors. When one prospect for the ruler of the seven kingdoms falls short Melisandre immediately switches her allegiance to the next likely candidate, Jon Snow. In a dangerous ceremony, she can bring the fallen hero back to life. While this might appear to be a plot contrivance but it provided a means to reinvent the factors driving the characters involvement in the story. Jon, the illegitimate son of the true King of the North, Lord Eddard Stark (Sean Bean), who was murdered back in the first season by the duplicitous and Machiavellian family, the Lannisters. The death of Lord Stark resulted in his children scattered throughout the world. This season furthers the task of reunited them. Jon joins up with his half-sister, Sansa Stark (Sophie Turner), has had an incredibly horrible life even by the cruel standards of the Seven Kingdoms. Sansa has been a pawn, continuously sacrificed by powerful men to further their ambitions. After a forced engagement and marriage intended to humiliate her, Sansa marries Ramsay Bolton (Iwan Rheon), a psychopathic, sexual sadist. After escaping, she can join forces with her half-brother, Jon. He recently left the cloistered watchman, The Nights Watch, to retake the traditional Stark home of Winterfell and assume the title of the King of the North, placing him in contention for the Iron Throne. A trademark of the series is remarkable special effects. Thanks to one of the largest budget episode any television series, the producers can bring the fertile imagination of Mr. Martin to life. This season escalates the intensity of the effects to an entirely new level. There is a scene of a vicious sea battle where a large fleet of ships is reduced to rubble within minutes by trio fire-breathing dragons. The dragons are under the control of the diminutive but deadly Daenerys Targaryen (Emilia Clarke). She is the daughter of a previous King of the Seven Kingdoms, King Aerys II Targaryen, the ""Mad King"" and has risen to power from a mere pawn as a bride to an overlord to a queen controlling one of the most powerful armed forces in the world. Daenerys has consolidated the equestrian warriors of the Dothraki with the unstoppable mercenary army, The Unsullied and a fleet of ships from the Iron Islands. She is not only a natural strategist but her position as Mother of Dragons,' affords an unbeatable position in any negotiation. She is also completely impervious the fire, a trait which came in handy when she dispatched an entire conclave of chieftains by setting fire to the tent and walking out of the flames unscathed. Most believe that the titular Fire and Ice refers to her and Jon Snow. One of the most startling transformations is undergone by Arya Stark (Maisie Williams) from a pre-teen tomboy to a teenage girl thoroughly train as a master assassin by the followers of the Many-Faced God, a cult of highly skilled killers that can put on other faces permitting them to assume any identity necessary. Arya is following a personal quest to kill a list of people who have wronged her. Practically every character depicted in this amazingly complicated and interwoven plot threads has some hidden agendas and list of secrets, but few can compare to Cersei Lannister (Lena Headey). There is a saying, ""men battle, and women wage war."", An exceptionally accurate description of how Cersei plays the game of thrones. She gave birth to three children sired by her twin brother, Ser Jaime Lannister (Nikolaj Coster-Waldau). Their two sons, cruel Joffrey (Jack Gleeson) and pliable Tommen (Dean-Charles Chapman), ascended briefly to the Iron Throne only to meet premature deaths. The both had the surname of the cuckold King Robert Baratheon. She has a younger brother, Tyrion Lannister (Peter Dinklage), who is always ridiculed and underestimated because he is a dwarf. He is exceptionally intelligent, well-read and a master of strategy and manipulation. Falsely accused of regicide, the murder of his nephew Joffrey he fled Kings Landing eventually becoming the political and military advisor to Daenerys, everything that transpired in this season is the culmination of the previous five years setting the stage for the inevitable climatic showdown. There are a few wild cards in the mix but the two principle opponents to unseat the current Queen of the Sven Kingdoms, Cersei, and the first of her name. She murdered all of the local opposition to one heinous move by burning the entire the Great Sept of Baelor, the center of power for the militant religious extremist, the High Sparrow who served as the High Septon of the Faith of the Seven. Cersei not only destroyed the bulk of the religious sect but the prominent members of several of the Great Houses that openly opposed her. This scene was one of the special effects highlights of the entire show directly contrasting the effects of Wildfire, an unquenchable green flame, with the extraordinary destruction of dragon breath. It seems the more questions are answered, the more pop up. This factor certainly builds the anticipation for the upcoming season seven."
6,4.5,"Epic season that, after the disappointing but still enjoyable Season 5, sets up for the series finale while probably being the best season to date. The cast is excellent, as usual, notably with the female actors who, after having their characters maligned in Season 5, come roaring back with vengeance. Whether it be Sophia Turner as Sansa Stark, who helps rally the North to overthrow the Ramsay Bolton, or Lena Headley as Cersei, who coolly brings about revenge against her enemies, this was the season that saw these fantastic characters revived. Behind the camera, show runners David Benioff & D.B. Weiss crafts an epic season that is now fully free of the books (the series has completely outpaced them now), setting up for the final two seasons by clearing the plate (once again, they are very effective in remedying the fact the cast has gotten too big). It builds to the epic 'Battle of the Bastards' of episode 9, in which Jon Snow & Ramsay Bolton lead their respective armies for control of the North. It's a powerful & emotional battle and probably the series best to that, building on everything that has come before. Best of all, this is the season in which a lot of fan theories are confirmed (one in particular is finally acknowledged) and makes fans longing for the next season. Probably the best season one of the best shows on TV ever."
6,5.0,"An amazing season with the last two episodes being two of the greatest episodes of Television ever. With Game of Thrones you never know what is going to happen, so you are always on the edge of your seat. This show is becoming the greatest show of all time. The score, drama, cinematography are all just better than every other show."
6,5.0,It is the best tv serial of alll time! Cant way to see connor mcgregor
6,5.0,perfecta solamente dijo eso
6,5.0,I give season 6 5 stars coz of episode 9.
6,2.5,"Some of the more anticipated moments ruined by poor writing, overly produced set pieces, and fan service. Still very entertaining, but the weakest season since the 1st, and I can decide which I like least."
6,5.0,Greatest show EVER!!!
6,5.0,"By far is the best season so far. Has everything from intrigue, action, good narrative and leaves us with the feeling of what will happen the next year while we get to their last seasons. 100% recommended, at this point if your friends have not seen it, I do not know why you have them."
6,5.0,"After a comparatively lackluster fifth season, Game of Thrones returns to form with it's most crowd-pleasing season yet."
6,5.0,"With all of the remaining characters starting to intertwine, this season is the best so far."
6,5.0,<@ if (review) { @><@= review @><@ } @>
6,5.0,Best season yet but all are awesome
6,5.0,Excepcional en muchos aspectos.
6,4.5,"What can I say about the most popular show on television? Personally, The Walking Dead is my favorite show of all time, but Game of Thrones is aclose 2nd or 3rd. Game of Thrones keeps bringing it every season and this season was no exception. Everyone who watches GoT knows that the 2nd to last episode of each season is always EPIC, ie. Red Wedding episode, Blackwater, Watchers on the Wall, Dance of Dragons. However, in Season 6 the last two episodes of the season were BOTH epic, Battle of the Bastards is the best hand to hand combat episode in GoT history and some might say it is one of the best battle scenes ever... and Winds of Winter was equally as epic but in a much darker, sinister way with great destruction. My only gripe about the show is that they should do 6+6, 7+7, or 8+8 episode seasons like the other shows do so we don't have to wait 12 months between each season? I am sure no one would complain if they aired 8 episodes, then took a break for a few months, then aired another 8 episodes. The 12 month break between seasons is too long, and by the time the new season comes around I've forgotten what happened in the previous season. That's just my opinion however."
6,4.5,"Very interesting season, full of action like all the other seasons of course, and had (in my opinion) the best 2 episodes or well 2 of the best episodes of all series, episode 10 Winds of Winter and episode 09 The Battle Of Bastards."
6,3.5,"The characters seem to go out of their way to avoid any conflict that could result in expensive action scenes, it's pathetic. That being said, the plot twists and Lena Heady make this a pretty good season."
6,5.0,Another great season
6,4.0,"Although better than season 5, it is not as good as the earlier seasons. Rushed pace and improbable plot points leave you with a feeling of how much better it could have been."
6,5.0,"Best season of any tv show ever by far, every episode was fantastic, especially the last two. As close to perfect as a tv season can get"
6,5.0,"Just when I thought this drama couldn't get better along came Season 6, albeit after a painfully long sabbatical, and I have become even more hooked. So glad The Lord Commander arose from the dead because I just couldn't see myself staying the course without him. I so wish that the amount of time between the end of this season and the next was not going to be so painfully long but I am sure it will be well worth the wait!"
6,5.0,Of Course .... the best series of all time
6,5.0,"The absolute best show on television. If you haven't started watching, push yourself through the first season and you'll be hooked, but don't get too attached, all men must die."
6,5.0,They've really outdone themselves. Favorite season thus far!
6,5.0,"Throughout 6 seasons, Game of Thrones has consistently been one of the most enthralling shows on TV. While season 6 started off a bit shaky, and seemed to start falling apart midway through, the last 2 episodes of the season were strong enough to make up for the several obvious faults of the rest of the season, which gave us lots of fan service, as well as the confirmation of a long held fan theory about one of the main characters."
6,5.0,"By far the best television drama I have ever seen. I have never seen a show just continue to get better and better the longer it goes on. Most episodes leave you on the edge of your seat, and season finales are almost painful. The show evokes every emotion on every level. You'll laugh, you'll cry (sob), you'll get pissed, and you'll yell at the top of your lungs when good things happen."
6,3.5,"Indeed GoT is now a regular TV show. Sure, its aesthetic and feeling are still there. The quality of screenplay, soundtrack and acting is good as before, as most of the TV series right now. However now the show has ultimately grown away from the books. The episodes are faster and denser with action, but the plot suffered a huge blow. Game of Thrones was immersive and intriguing because of its realistic multilayered plots, related to several characters. All of this has been watered down - some will say dumbed down. All new characters are now mere sidekicks of the already familiar ones. The show has lost all its courage, and with that its unique merit."
6,4.5,"The high-production-value fanfic of Game of Thrones continues! At the time of writing, the show has now outpaced the books, so fans of the books (myself included) have now wandered into a brave new world where all bets are off. If Ned Stark taught us anything, nobody is safe. As usual, there are many deaths. It is a testament to how many named characters there are that the series can kill so many of them and yet still have such a large cast. The characters range the gamut from the beloved to the behated (who says only Shakespeare can invent words?); as previously mentioned, no one is safe. We start to see the pieces moving towards the endgame; Daenerys is gathering her forces, Cersei is consolidating her power, the White Walkers creep ever closer to the Wall, and all kinds of excitement is happening in Winterfell. The season ends up in a weirdly happy place (as happy as GoT can get, anyway). We see a lot of characters we like get what they want, as well as some information we have been waiting the entire series to learn. What happens in the next season is anyones guess; I just hope the quality stays this good."
6,5.0,Another strong season of game of thrones
6,5.0,A breath of fresh air. It will make you jump out of your seat!
6,5.0,The best tv series of all time!
6,5.0,the best thing ive ever seen.... ^_^
6,4.5,"This show makes me crazy with the infrequent payoffs, but this time we got paid."
6,5.0,"Baru kali ini ane nonton serial 1 season ada twistnya tiap episode. Kaya ditembak machine gun , bertubi. Serial kaya gini ni yang bikin kuat marathon. The best season so far, ga ada bintang 6 ya ini ?"
6,5.0,"This was without a doubt, by far, the BEST season of Game of Thrones! It certainly made up for last season, where only the last three episodes were the best. David and Dan went above and beyond, pulling out all the stops to execute perfection. Phenomenal costumes and cinematography as always, the acting never fails, congrats to Maisie for her Emmy nomination, she deserved it. Both Arya and Sansa have grown into their own strong characters this season. The penultimate episode is usually the most climatic, so I assumed they wouldn't be able to top ""The Battle of The Bastards"", but W-O-W!!!! ""The Winds of Winter"" blew that out of the water and blew the roof off... Literally!"
6,4.0,Slow start but extraordinary end
6,5.0,"This season reignited my interested in the series, and what a blast it was. I'm back on the Thrones wagon and I can't wait for the next season."
6,2.5,"Acting was good as usual, effects were great and all in all the visuals were spot on, however I found that the story was completely lacking this season. WTF was Dorne? Sansa? Teleporting Baelish/Varys/Dornish armies? The Ironborn kingsmoot was disappointing while the Tyrion scenes were a waste of minutes and a poor substitute for Dinklage's usual witty scenes. On the plus side, I enjoyed Cersei's KL scenes, the simplicity of Tommen's death, the Bron and Pod reunion, and of course the sassy Lyanna Mormont."
6,5.0,"Best season of GoT yet! Maybe it was mostly because after seasons of enduring pain for our beloved main characters, we're finally seeing them slowly succeeding or gaining progress now."
6,5.0,I don't know whether it's because I fancy Jon Snow or whether its because the show is so good I have watched every episode plus enjoyed every Thonecast and can't wait for next season.
6,4.5,"Although there were a few slow episodes, Game of Thrones once again proved that it is the best show on Television and capable of creating marvellous work especially through episodes like ""The Door"", ""Battle of the Bastards"" and ""The Winds of Winter"". The cast you expect to be brilliant are, however it is from performances like that of Sophie Turner, (who really fleshes how out her once-soft character into a stone cold badass) which demonstrate the constant changing and improvement of the show as a whole."
6,5.0,"If your not all caught up on GoT ""Shame, Shame, Shame..."" This season features the series most optimistic arc and the greatest battle sequence ever filmed. Surprisingly less of that He-Man woman hate the previous seasons so firmly cemented into the landscape of Westeros. Perhaps not gone; the misogynistic overtones have been replaced with female leaders ruling the lands armies and a little bear sparking the nomination for a new ruler. So your 54 episodes behind, there's about the that many weeks till the season 7 premier. If you can resist do so, but trust me if you start you'll be here one day; wishing there were more than 12-15 hours left in the series."
6,5.0,i loved this season but i think the Braavos part it wasnt cool to see
6,5.0,Amazing....best season since season 3. Only complaint is not enough episodes
6,5.0,One of the strongest seasons of the show.
6,5.0,Just brilliant apart from the predictability of a few outcomes there was still a few surprises that I didn't see coming well done to everyone -what a show
6,4.5,"Despite a couple 'slow' episodes, season six provides us with the two best episodes of the series, and some of the best television programs in history."
6,5.0,this is the best thing i will ever see
6,5.0,El extraño caso de una serie que no se cansa de ser excelentemente hecha
6,5.0,Can I give season six a 6 star rating?!? Awesome show!
6,5.0,Best TV series ever! I love how smart the story is and of course the special effect and the casts!
6,5.0,This season just kept getting better!
6,5.0,yrion seeks a strange ally; Bran learns a great deal; Brienne goes on a mission; Arya is given a chance to prove herself
6,5.0,The BEST season yet!!!
6,5.0,Jon snow king of the north!
6,5.0,Favorite series ever
6,3.0,"Thankfully the last 2 episodes are the saving grace of an otherwise boring, dull and stale season. There is an abundance of recycled themes, fanservice, abandoned plotlines and internet memes that makes you question whether the showrunners know what they're doing."
6,5.0,The most satisfying season yet.
6,5.0,"Best show ever. Best season so far. So incredibly beautiful in imagery, story, music. Leaves me thinking about this world long after."
6,5.0,the best show on tv!
6,1.0,Show is on a downward spiral. GRRM can't write anymore and the show is bastardizing what remains of the books. Boo
6,0.5,"A very bad written show,but with a great budget.The show focuses only to amuse the fans and lacks of surpise,the show became very predictable.Everyone predicted the whole season just from the very first trailer.Game of thrones is just a very beautiful sh*t,beautiful on the outside,but inside is really bad,it's full of bad writing and stupid shock values,they don't respect the source material."
6,5.0,"WOW! I am in love with this show! I didn't think I would like to watch things from this era , but I love it! Can't get enough of it! Keeps getting better and better! You never know what's going to happen!"
6,3.5,"SPOILERS!!! By its own high standards, the last season of Game of Thrones (Season Five) was an utter disaster. It was also the first season where the show went decidedly off-book, combining elements of two apparently scattershot sources into one while making up its own shortcuts along the way. It gave us the infuriatingly bland Dorne storyline, an increased focus on Ramsay Boltons uninteresting brand of sadism, the faceless Sons of the Harpy, and a dragon ride that looked like something out of The Neverending Story. It wasnt all a waste; Stannis arc was dark but fantastic, and the battle of Hardhome is likely the single best sequence the show has ever done. However, every attempt to expand the word (except perhaps Aryas) fell completely flat. Given that Season Six was now completely off-book, it would be reasonable to assume it would only get worse from here. However, it course-corrects by collapsing the world instead of continually expanding it, both setting up Season Seven wonderfully and standing as the most satisfying season the show has ever had. Its a comfortable season in a way, only once really throwing caution to the wind, but even if the narrative is no longer as daring as it once was, Thrones earns its position as must-see TV. Game of Thrones can be a difficult show to discuss broadly, simply because there are so many characters spread out over such a large distance, both narratively and physically. Season Six corrects much of this almost immediately, bringing together Brienne, Davos, Melisandre, Jon, and Sansa by the fourth episode. Two of the Starks reuniting at last is particularly satisfying, and while the Jon/Sansa story ends with a beautiful if nonsensical battle sequence, having the two characters together again is magnificent (and inspired; Jon/Arya, Sansa/Arya, or even Jon/Theon are the more obvious reunions to stage, but Jon/Sansa allows us a character pairing that was never really explored before but still harkens back to the beginning of the show). In perhaps the weakest point of the season, a carryover from the last, Dany remains separated from Mereen, where Tyrion, Varys, Missandei, and Grey Worm sit in big rooms and talk about nothing. Varys gets one fantastic scene where he attempts to rebuild his network, but otherwise there is no air left in the Mereen scenes. Danys reunion with the Dothraki, on the other hand, works by bringing in familiar things, and when the whole gang gets together at the end (along with some others), it leads to an incredibly satisfying ending, even if its a season-and-a-half overdue. Even when characters are sent off, its not usually to meet new ones, but to bring together old combinations. Jamie repopulates Cerseis circle for a while, but is sent off to Riverrun to break a Tully siege. This brings the long-abandoned characters of Walder Frey, Edmure Tully, and the Blackfish back into the fold at last, and also gives us Jamie/Brienne and Bronn/Podrick reunion. We return to Bran north of the wall, where his warging ability is used to fill in gaps in our knowledge about the realm (only slightly more elegantly than outright flashbacks), and another long-lost character re-emerges. Most dramatically, the Hound re-appears with a group of new characters, who are lent credence by the presence of Ian McShane and the fact that they link into Cerseis current struggle by showing another side of the seven. And, once again, they quickly dovetail into abandoned parts of the narrative by bringing back the Brotherhood Without Banners, led by Beric Dondarrion. Relatively few new arcs are created, but old arcs are allowed to pay off and loose ends tied off. Some of these are unsatisfying; the ends of the Blackfish and Osha the wildling are rather unfortunately tossed off despite the two being interesting characters anchored by charismatic performances. But by-and-large the contraction of the world is propels the narrative forward, which is very preferable to the meandering of the last couple seasons. Even Dorne benefits from this; the storyline only appears twice, once to necessarily close a few dangling threads, and a second time to ally them with more interesting characters and bring them into a storyline that actually might be interesting. Its hard to overstate how great it is to have The Hound back. In his second episode, when he calls a generic bad guy out for being shit at dying, Thrones operates on a darkly humorous level it occasionally reaches elsewhere in the season with Zombie Mountain and WunWun the Giant. The Hound and The Mountain and violent, and in the latter case especially, reprehensible characters, but having The Hounds pragmatic violence in play stands in stark contrast to the brutal sadism of characters like Ramsay Bolton. Ramsay gets to be the worst again for the first half of the season, but thankfully disappears until the Battle of Winterfell, aka the Battle of the Bastards, which is perhaps the worst of the major battle episodes Thrones has done (ranking: Hardhome, Blackwater, Watchers on the Wall, Bastards). Even the Knights of Vales last minute arrival feels exactly like Blackwater four seasons ago. The Starks face great losses, but triumph of Ramsay, and while its great to see good get a win, its a Pyrrhic one made to look clean in post. A lot could be made of Jons strategical blunders, which get a lot of men killed, but its swept under the table swiftly. When the Northerners proclaim him King in the North, the rah-rah moment is deflated not only because of Sansas potential claim, but because he had just proven himself a great warrior but not a particularly even-headed leader. That being said, Ramsays sadism pays off a bit with his treatment of Rickon, even if its a bit unbelievable that Jon would fall for this trick there, and it has some beautiful images from director Miguel Sapochnik. Aryas Braavos and Danys Mereen storyline also come to a close in satisfying ways. Its arguable whether Arya gained much as a character after the past two seasons, but Id argue she has grown incredibly, and the moments in Braavos are so well filmed and so engaging that I wouldnt want to see them shortened. A lot has been made of the disappointing dispatching of The Waif, but the final moment of imply-dont-show worked perfectly for me, and her time spent watching a dramatic re-interpretation of Season One was hilarious and one of the clear world-building steps of the season. Meanwhile, its fantastic to have Dany finally converging on the mainland, and it even manages to bring the Iron Islanders back in as well. The Kingsmoot storyline was relatively engaging as well, as Yara is a great presence and Theon works outside of Ramsays control, even though Eurons weird Donald Trump-esque performance was a bit odd. If were talking satisfying resolutions thought, Cerseis storyline in Kings Landing is the end-all-be-all, and the season finale, The Winds of Winter, is one of the best episodes the show has ever done. Its opening thirty minutes are thrilling, beautiful, and explosive, and the most shocking the show has been since the Red Wedding. It clears the table in a dramatic way, and while some great characters bite the bullet, in retrospect its the only way forward for this storyline, given that winter is coming. A lot of the conversation around Game of Thrones revolves around deaths, which is always a bad sign about a show. There should always be things to get invested in with characters other than death, and while Thrones isnt the worst offender of DeathWatch culture, it traffics in it a fair amount. Before closing, its worth noting the emphasis on women in this season. Thrones has justifiably come under fire before for its treatment of women as objects, whether through sexposition or killing them left-right-and-centre (or, in Rozs case, both!). It really came to a head last season with Sansas Ramsay storyline, which I think was a reasonable storyline decision told horribly due to important parts being given through Theons point of view. In this season, women take control, and outside of potentially Jon Snow, every character who gains power this season is a woman. Theon rejects his title and acts as a supporter to his sister Yara, Dany brings fire-and-blood spectacle back, Cersei takes over Kings Landing, the Dornish women and the Queen of Thorns find a feminine monarch to stand behind, and Sansa gets her revenge and retakes her childhood home (and sets up conflict with Jon when the people overlook her as Queen in the North). Even Margaery, who ends up in a not-so-great place, goes down swinging, a victim of playing the long game against Cerseis willingness to flip the board over violently. Additionally, while the show doesnt shy away from nudity, its much less reliant on the gratuitous nudity it so frequently employed before. A lot of what came before can be somewhat understood as reflective of the real conditions for women in medieval settings, but having the climax depend so strongly on the actions of the female characters is a refreshing change of pace. In short, stuff happens, and the show is finally using the world it has built rather than trying to stack its deck further and further. However, the show is less-and-less able to enjoy anything not directly related to the plot. Travel becomes a bit funky, and the show stops taking its time in the journey. In a way, weve already seen a lot of what Westeros has to offer, and it is nice that things are a bit brisker. That being said, a bit of emphasis on the journey would be nice, and the side-scenes that used to take place on the road (remember Arya and the Hound?) now seem to be confined to palaces, with such awful scenes as Tyrion, Missandei, and Grey Worm figuring out the essence of humour. Putting plot ahead of character and world has made for a very satisfying season, but not the very best the show has ever done. Its drawbacks are a necessary evil, and set up an exciting final two seasons, but the journey was more involving than the destination."
6,4.5,"Puntaje Original: 8.5 Pocas cosas me convierten en un fanático, y Game of Thrones lo logró, así que con orgullo digo que soy un Fan de Game of Thrones. Gracias George R.R. Martin, D.B. Weiss, David Bennioff, todo el elenco, y todos los que hicieron posible esta maravilla."
6,5.0,"i do not wait for any TV show at all, but now i did."
6,5.0,A MASTERPIECE! 10/10
6,5.0,"Game of thornes just went up a step, now we can not compare it with other series, but movies, this season everything was perfect (I will reveal small errors), the battle of the bastards was one of the finest battles I've ever seen life, photography, special effects, screen elements, acting, all spectacular, and the episode ten wordless perfect closing, congratulations, best season of the series so far. They'll have to work hard to excel in season seven."
6,5.0,"One of the best seasons yet, due to the fact that almost every storyline is so meaningful and important to us. Then we also get another epic battle, that's right up there with Snow vs White Walkers and Stannis' march to Kings Landing. As usual, HBO serves up the perfect receipe of T&A, excitement, suspense, thrills, fear, uncertainty and bewilderment. Just what the doctor ordered."
6,5.0,"Hated them killing Hodor and Osha, loved episodes 9 and 10 !!!"
6,5.0,"The north remembers, and the mummer's farce is almost done. Winter is finally here."
6,5.0,The most epic so far!
6,5.0,"comparing to all the other seasons, this one was the best so far. I fell in love with the characters and think I became an actual fan) although I'm not that type of person. So what id like to say is that everything is perfect in this show: actors, plot, sound effects etc. I can imagine how bad all the fans (including me) will feel when the show is over:("
6,5.0,One of the best tv shows ever.
6,5.0,Absolutely the best episode they've come up with. The music was captivating and the series is on track for some massive developments after this finale.
6,4.0,Seasons continues on the great season five. Lots of answer are given and things really starts to be set in motion.
6,5.0,"Being the first season to run out of source material to adapt from (and in light of season 5 beings the show's most turgid year), it's logical the writing staff for Game of Thrones made a very wise yet brief decision going ahead with season 6: give the fans what they want. No longer bogged down by George R. R. Martin's grievous storytelling, Game of Thrones instead concentrated on delivering immense action set pieces, and exciting reveals. Nearly every episode this season ranks among the series best, and to say much more would be spoiling. Game of Thrones has once re-asserted itself as not just being a brilliant work of genre storytelling, but one of the very best dramas on television."
6,5.0,"Best Season so far, really excited about the next season. By far the most exciting show i have watched in a long time."
6,5.0,"Amazing, exciting, thrilling, Best season finale ever!! can't wait for more."
6,3.5,"The sixth season of Game of Thrones was quite a visual spectactle and has definetly reached new heights of what a tv series can offer. Unfortunately the writing was not nearly as satisfying as I wanted it to be. While the plot ideas were good conceptually, they weren't handled well enough and left me scratching my head on several occasions. The weakest part of the season were the characters, which were formerly all part of the bigger picture. Now hovewer it feels like some of them are exempt from the rules the series set up and succeed because the plot demands them to, which would have been fine had their success been plausible."
6,4.0,"Finally, something's happening. Still, many of cringe-worthy scene."
6,4.0,"La sexta temporada de Game of Thrones llegó para continuar superándose, cada vez el desarrollo de la acción es más épico, los personajes siguen creciendo y todo se establece al punto de maduración que ya permite sentir que todo fluye hacia el cauce conclusivo de la saga. Ésta es el primer año en que la producción televisiva no tiene la estructura de los libros de George R.R. Martin y lo resuelve bastante bien, el estilo de narración sigue manteniéndose con eventos tan crudos y sorpresivos como siempre. De los diez episodios se puede destacar el regreso de varios personajes que no estuvieron presentes en años anteriores con roles muy relevantes. Sobre el contenido de los episodios lo más trascendental sucede en el Norte con Sansa, y en Essos con Daenerys, quienes retoman su historia en la condición de damiselas en apuros y a lo largo de cada capítulo van reconstruyéndose para tener un rol más participativo en la lucha por sus objetivos. Ésta no es la mejor de todas las temporadas de Game of Thrones pero aun así es muy buena, hay uno o dos episodios que dilatan mucho la espera de los acontecimientos importantes, pero sin dudas es la que ha requerido mayor esfuerzo de producción, logrando una de las mejores escenas de batallas de la serie y dejando mucha expectativa sobre el futuro de Westeros."
6,4.5,"It breaks free from the source material, there were some good input but other decisions were questionable."
6,5.0,"Game of Thrones continues to impress with its breathtaking visuals, engrossing storytelling, powerhouse performances from its cast and a potent grip to tie all the pieces together - resulting in perhaps the most compelling show on television."
6,5.0,asa asa bayrak kalmad?.
6,5.0,Excelencia pura!!!!!
6,5.0,GoT season 6 - Best Season Finale ever :)
6,3.5,"Weakest of the seasons so far, storylines and characters felt paper thin and I question some of the decisions made. The final two episodes were terrific, especially the finale, but they can't make up for what came before to get me to grade this season at heights that I have in the past."
6,5.0,"Overall a great season, with a slow start and build up."
6,5.0,"Season 6 is the best season of Game of Thrones yet, i am already counting down the days till season 7 starts"
6,5.0,"As close to a perfect season as we have seen so far, Season Six went the extra mile by tying up a number of plot-lines, bringing back characters that we haven't seen for years (and sometimes letting them live), and delivering some of the best must-see episodes of the series, including the best season finale yet."
6,4.0,A season mais fraca que valeu pelos 2 últimos episódios.
6,5.0,"Though not all seasons are equally strong, season 6 is the most rewarding season of Game of Thrones thus far, with a lot of satsifying answers and great surprises. A season that also did extremely well now that it has outpaced the books. The happiest season yet, but also the best."
6,4.0,"The sixth and perhaps riskiest season (due to the books) of GoT shines with the same character depth as always -- but with more visual glamor and of course, twists. It's fun to see the continuous journey of our beloved characters, good as bad ones. It's one hell of a ride with many turns, and the scope have greatly gone bigger -- there aren't that many of the main characters left and the action is greatly superior. The plot continues to introduce new storylines, and it might be too many for the show's own good but we love it don't we. It's one hell of a show, but it might have some small fragments of predictability, expositions, pacing issues & rushed moments throughout some of the episodes. Add the fact that it might have become a bit fan-service-ish & stretched out yes; well it's not flawless! But let's not forget what makes the show so great. It's the characters -- their interactions, personalities and journey through this world that really matters. It's the continuation we all wanted -- especially the season finale! Can't wait for season 7! Overall personal rating for each episode: 79.1/100 Overall critical rating for each episode: 87/100 Personal rating: 83/100 Critical rating: 85/100"
6,5.0,"Game of Thrones continues its masterful story in the epic sixth season despite some slow stretches, creating one of the best battle scenes to ever be filmed, and pulling out emotionally powerful moments of distress, heartbreak, and ultimate satisfaction as the show finally put the chess pieces in place for the long awaited wars to come."
6,5.0,"100% (A+) Another season, another masterpiece. Winter is here better than ever in this 10 episodes season; including the best episode ever made on TV and in the entire Game of thrones show. And the best season finale ever. Tension, tears, emotions, and hundreds of different feelings are what season 6 brought us during this year. I´ll be desperate waiting for the penultimate season. 2017 is coming."
6,5.0,"Battle for Winterfell was up to Hollywood blockbuster movie budget standards, Story pacing was excellent, deaths of otherwise simpleton characters reveal heart wrenching secrets that were good kept for surprise effect and a finale that made me wanna kill myself instead of waiting another whole year for it to continue."
6,4.5,After a dark season full of losses this season gives the losers wins and triumphs especially for many of the female characters in the show. It's also a fantastic season for acting and shows new aspects to the show not seen before and in my mind is the best season i've seen from this show. Unless were talking about Arya who the entire season is an arc that starts in confusion but ends in a fantastic direction of revenge and triumph and sets up what is most likely going to be the most powerful and battle filled season yet. Grade for this season: A
6,5.0,"This season has proven that less is ALOT more. The leaner and meaner shorter season format has done away with filler scenes and wandering plotlines, to make the best season of Game of Thrones yet! The last two episodes putting this summers biggest films to shame...shame...shame. #WinterIsHere"
6,4.5,THE KING IN THE NORTH THE KING IN THE NORTH THE KING IN THE NORTH THE KING IN THE NORTH
6,5.0,Best Television Series EVER!
6,4.5,Very exciting season with many ups and a few downs. Strong emotional moments and overall seemingly preparing fairly well for a final season.
6,5.0,Best show on television.
6,5.0,"I love this season, the ep. 9 was one of the best in tv history. The director Miguel Sapochnik give us an incredible episode again!"
6,1.0,honestly this series is getting repeditive
6,5.0,strong scripted season
6,5.0,Episódio fantástico em todos os sentidos!
6,4.5,Best season yet. Satisfying reveals and plot reveals.
6,3.5,"A complete reversal of the previous seasons. There seems to be an obvious feminist ""women are powerful"" narrative this season, and I have to say, the show is better for it. RR Martin's murder porn could only limp the plot along so far. I think the current season is a pretty big divergence from the narrative, and the female take over of the show is definitely a deliberate over-correction of the previously male centered exploration of GRRM's sadism. At times the previous seasons were torturous to watch and at times worthy of rage-quitting the show. It's nice to see that the current writing deviates from that, but in a way it deviates too far. Some writing is sub par when looking at the rest of the show, however some select scenes are (no spoilers) of very high quality.Whether those plot points are inspired or gifted from GRRM or from the GoT TV team, I cannot say. But either way, this season leaves you feeling satisfied, where before there would be only emptiness and frustration."
6,5.0,"While season 6 started off a bit slow, with the first two or three episodes used for recap and buildup, it ended on a high note featuring several of the show's best episodes. This season divided many; with some calling it one of the series's best, and some calling it its worst. It's hard to say for sure which is which, it just comes down to personal opinion, but even on its darkest day ""Game of Thrones is better than almost anything on TV."
6,5.0,best series ever on tv
6,1.0,The worst season so far...
6,1.5,This is the worst season of this show.
6,3.0,Episodes 6-8 are really disappointing. Boring as hell. The last two better be incredible in order to save this season.
6,2.0,"Minor characters such as Hodor, Daavos, and Brienne were the highlight of this season, rather than actual plot development. Timing throughout this season was either too slow or too fast. Dany's storyline was simply regurgitated. Arya finally gained some kind of meaningful identity, after wasting time in Braavos. So little has been accomplished in the 8 hours so far. Hopefully the last two episode will make up for it."
6,5.0,Best hour TV series of all Time. I wish there were at least 12 episodes in a season.
6,4.5,Other then the weakest premiere of any of the seasons. It has since stepped up considerably each episode. You'll have story lines your into more but no one feels like a waste and can start to see the pivotal part each will play for the end game. Huge reveals don't overshadow the growth we've seen from some of these great characters
6,5.0,"Love game of thrones, I hope danerys does something this season."
6,5.0,THE BEST TV SHOW I EVER SEEN !!! I WILL TAKE WHATS IS MINE WITH FIRE AND BLOOD !!!
6,5.0,It's been many years since I've enjoyed a program anywhere near as much as I've enjoyed this season of Game of Thrones. The second 5 I've given to a TV show to date.
6,5.0,The best TV show currently on TV
6,4.5,"An improvement from the last season, Game of Thrones is back with more bloody betrayals, ruthless political conflicts, and the return of old faces. By now the series has gone mostly off the page, which gives it both an improvement and yet weaken certain aspects of the story. Sophie Turner as Sansa Stark definitely is one of the best performance in the show, other honorable mention include Jonathan Pryce as the cunning High Sparrow, Liam Cunningham as the ever loyal Ser Davos, and Maisie Williams as Arya Stark. Other performances are great as well. The pacing is faster compared to season 5, it makes the story move along faster and giving us a better plot advance. But at time it also give way to some plot hole and forced story telling. But i guess it's relatively minor and doesn't significantly lower the story's quality."
6,5.0,We love daenerys targaryen and arya stark
6,2.0,"Things continue to not make sense from last year. There has been a slight improvement, but overall, the show is not what it once was."
6,5.0,"Emocionante e sangrenta, brutal e tocante... Game of Thrones consegue angariar a mais ampla gama de sentimentos à uma produção grandiosa, como quase nunca se vê na TV. É um dos maiores épicos de todos os tempos!"
6,5.0,"My favorite show. I love everything about it. The actors are spot on, the clothing and settings are magnificent. There is nothing I don't like about Game of Thrones!"
6,5.0,"Thus far Season 6 is the season we've all been waiting for. I've never been as pleased with character decisions in any of the past seasons, and we're only halfway through! It's clear Martin isn't writing this script."
6,5.0,"The show is to perfect, every season is incredible."
6,5.0,"Never thought Hodor would have that kind of mishap, that his destiny is to hold the god damn door! it is kind of funny yet cruel thing, better yet Bran still disappoint us as always been the walking disaster to himself or to others. And now Summer is dead and you know what is coming next."
6,5.0,"Outside of season one, which was epic political intrigue and mystery solving that mostly mirrored the first book of the series, every season since has been struggling to balance the show's humor and brutality. Meanwhile, the show's heart has been buried under ineffective but fun pairings (Bronn and Jaime), the Dorne plot where not even avid book readers know which Sand Snake is which and fans of the series still might not know what the heck a Sand Snake is. But when Jon Snow reunited with Sansa, the heart of the show returned. Sure, there have been tear jerking moments, even in season 5, but the show seemed a little lost-- like it was waiting for the green light to go balls to the wall. A lot of people were afraid that when the show received that green light (i.e., the move beyond the books) that the show would continue to be more about set pieces and violence for the sake of violence. I never felt the show was that kind of show, but last season didn't set right with me. This season is half way done and part of the best thing about having more Starks around is the return of the Stark theme. I love the music of Game of Thrones, and that's my favorite. The biggest reveal from this season isn't anything that's happened plot-wise. It's that the writers, after a lackluster 5th season where they seemed to meander, still understand what made the show and the novels great in the first place. They have delivered more moments in five episodes than all of last season."
6,3.5,"Ugh. GOT gone Hollywood. Where all the breasts are perfect, White Walkers now leg-drag like the walking dead, and we pull old formulas out of the fire. OH. And no more dire wolves, and dragons only off camera. You had me when gritty girl walks out of fire. You lost me when she did it again all oiled with perfect hair. Formula fave. WTF GOT?"
6,4.5,"GOT taps into our subconscious by taking us far away into lands and people we do not recognize and, in turn, we react emotionally as if we are feeling their experiences firsthand. We may not always know whats going on and why, however, the emotions and moods are felt viscerally and deeply untethered by understanding to fully experience what is happening."
6,4.0,"We have now been treated to 4 episodes in the sixth season of the fantastic Game of Thrones in which I believe is shaping up to be the best on of the series. We have been given 2 action packed episodes and 2 episodes that have allowed brilliant character progression and evolution. The story is quickly growing and giving us more and more to sink our teeth into and I am enjoying every taste of what is being delivered. The story is compelling, the acting has been brilliant and it is leaving us with plenty to speak about. Only 4 episodes in and we have seen some influential characters killed off in true Game of Thrones style. I for one think the sixth season is offering us everything we need and is going by to quickly, all the world is talking about is this fantastic series and so they should. For me the series gets a 9.4 and one hell of a thumbs up"
6,5.0,"season 5 ended with an awful; lot of questions. the superhyped show started this season and as the season unfolds we get most of our questions answered. some which goes as proposed by fan theories and as you know Game of Thrones can never be complete without surprising from the creators which keeps us all glued to our tv sets every sunday. for the season the conversations have not very solid as they used to. we meet the almighty Tyrion ''a man full of wits'' saying some empty words. i also don't think any viewer still need convincing that Ramsay is the most badass character in the show. that point is well proved. isnt tyrion also wasting his wits in meeren doing nothing. the whole dorne thing wasnt good at all. and surprising we are seeing less nude scenes. the union in episode 4 as touching. bran still with the three-eyed raven ,really?"
6,4.5,"s06e04...best episode of season. one of the best of the series...pieces on the board really moved...instead of snail pace, there were big moves....hope for a steady story line for the rest of the season."
6,5.0,So far this season is overall the strongest since season 1 for me.

6,5.0,one word : Whaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaammmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm!
6,3.5,"Last season presented the first clearly negative fan response to Game of Thrones, even if the critics didn't feel the same. Thankfully, the show's creators seem to have heard fans to some extent and ignored television critics, who rarely seem to have any comprehension as to the quality of a show (see good reviews for Supergirl, Arrow, etc.). Whereas last season was full of Walking Dead style missteps that teased audiences with action that never materialized, Season 6 is clearly taking steps to remedy that, even if it means a bit of shoehorning and some quick set changes. What's becoming infinitely clear is that we are certainly off the reservation in terms of the books. While Martin was never a particularly prolific writer, his books certainly had a historically grounded vision, which is now noticeably missing. Although the authors have had discussions with Martin, there is clearly a sense that action minded, television producers have taken over story development, a fact clearly reflected in a major tonal shift between this and last season. This isn't all bad however and the season has had a relatively strong start. On the negative side however, GOT is still struggling to balance so many storylines in a single hour. The re-addition of Brand isn't really helping with that and the packing reflects in certain character's development (see Sand Snakes, who I am still confused about on a number of levels). Overall however, Season 6 seems to be on a healthy track. Let's just hope the Mother of Dragons gets off the ground soon enough."
6,5.0,fantastic opening that keeps you wanting more
6,5.0,Wooooooooop! Also that's what you get negative-nancy critics for reviewing a season based on the first episode!! At least I can edit my score if it somehow turns to sh#t later in the season.
6,0.5,"Ok so here is one of the truest recaps you'll ever see: The brothers of the Night's Watch left Jons body outside because that of course makes sense. It's not like he told them about a huge army of ice zombies at Hardhome. Stabbing him was also a stupid idea because for the previous mentioned reason. Ramsay had a ""touching"" scene. Why though? Don't make him more interesting by making me feel for him. He is just pure evil and there is nothing you should do about it. First Ramsay is Ramsay and that means he's an evil asshole so of course he has to rape Sansa which still doesn't make any sense for that storyline. Now they want to make him less of an asshole it appears and be sad about his dead lover. What a bunch of crap. Sansa, a half Tully, half Stark is afraid of cold water and has to be helped by a tortured guy who actually should be the one getting help from her. The line ""I won't make it without you"" is utter crap. HE should be the one not making it without her. Then Brienne appears and kills everyone without hesitation because why should she question knighthood? Themes are so boring. Dumb killing scenes are way better. And lastly in that storyline we have Sansa forgetting the words for accepting someone into their service because that's not something she should have been able to do in her sleep. God these writers hate Sansa. Always doing something to make her look stupid. Coming back from Dorne with Trystane was also a stupid idea. The boat wasn't even that far away from the coast. They could have turned that ship around damn it. Killing off the Martells? That also makes no sense. No there's no Martell left except for Quentyn and Arianne. Oh wait. These 2 aren't in the story because apparently we had to make room for unnecessary scenes and more butchered plotlines. ""Weak men."" Yeah that's feminism. Remember when the writers told us we get strong women this season? Because strong women tell me they're week when they're just really political. ""Cersei"" and ""Jaime"" are together because themes are dumb and Jaime has no need to be in the Riverlands trying to grow apart from her. Tyrion as ruler is also very dumb because there are other people more suitable like Missandei and Grey Worm for example. You know, people who know the place and are POC. Jorah and Daario on a brotrip is also very needed because we didn't have enough of that in Dorne with Jaime and Bronn. Finding the ring? How very lucky. I'm also very glad that we had to make room for rape jokes and these 2 very funny dothraki sidekicks. Not that we could have uses that time for more character development of another character or Lady Stoneheart or Arianne Martell. The waif being an asshole is also very cool I guess. There's nothing better than more hate relationships between women. AAAAAAnnnddd lastly we have a naked Melisandre for the male gaze. The season's starting of great.?"
6,5.0,"Episode 1: Cant express my excitement about the fact that the time has come for another season. Its no secret that this was a setup episode that touched on and recapped many different stories without delving into any one in a ton of detail. Nonetheless, it was great and enjoyable. Episode 2: Another great episode, but nothing particular to add. It's nice to see Bran again after it's been so long. I'm extremely glad John Snow is back. Can't believe what Remsey is doing... Episode 3: Loving the new John Snow and the flashbacks. I'd like to point how amazing the cinematography is. It always looks right and appropriate, and is something I think the audience often takes for granted. Episode 4 ------------- I finally got what I was looking for! I absolutely loved Daenerys's rebirth as she soon like a God in the burning flames. She has been mistreated and mistrusted the past little while, and I feel that at times even she lost faith in herself. However, we now see that she is as strong as ever. Tyrion's skillset is still undervalued as he is essentially governing the state while the Queen is gone. Little finger is finally back and seems to have a complete hold over the Vale. John snow and Sansa's reunion was extremely touching. This was an episode filled with both emotion adn power and moved a few plot lines very far along. Episode 5 ------------- Amazing episode! Definitely the best episode of the season so far. I'm glad to see Aria's story progress a bit, but what we see is that she well never become a ""no one"". She will never forget her past, and she will never blindly follow orders. I'm curious to see where her plot line takes her. Daenerys and Jorah finally make up in what is a very confusing friend-friend, father-daughter, lover-lovedone relationship. This is a great opportunity for Tyrion to finally showcase his leadership skills. He is one of my favorite characters and I can't wait for him to get the credit he deserves. The Greyjoys are finally trusting each other and taking action. I'm glad that Theon finally got his tonge back. Unfortunately there are some things he just won't be able to get back... The last season was simply stunning. An action packed thrilling runaway scene, intertwined with the deaths of many characters (the tree dwellers, the old man who lives in the tree, Hodor...), that flips back and forth between the present and a flashback that tells us the story of how Hodor got his name along with the fate that awaited him all these years. So much in such a shorter scene, but it was so well done that I was left speechless. Episode 6  The biggest question I have after watching this episode is where the hell is Arias plot going to take her? Whats her role going to be in the grander scheme of all of this? Episode 7 ------------- John is slowly building an army building up the anticipating for the battle ahead. Arya looks like she's about to die. The hound's anger keeps accumulates furthermore even as he tries to find peace. Jaime is being a boss, and Margeary has a plan. Just another typical episode of Game of Thrones. Episode 8 ------------- The hound is transforming, in a good way. I think there is an imminent reunion between him an Arya in the very near future. Speaking of Arya, it was a great sense of relief to see that she has been able to escape the many faced gods and will be able to return, stronger and faster, to her home. As always, Tyrion doesn't let me down and keeps kicking ass; in a metaphorical sense. Episode 9 ------------- As always, the second last episode of the season does not disappoint. An epic display of power by Daenerys. An eloquent message from Tyrion. An unbelievably amazing fight scene against the boltons that made me feel like I'm really there, on the battle field! I have no words to describe how realistic this felt. A phenomenal performance act of swordsmanship, courage and stupidity by John Snow. A lovely surprise from Sansa, and proof that she's not just giving in to the men around her, but is smarter than most people think. She literally saved the day! It was sad to see the wildling giant die, but for Rickon I had less compassion since I barely knew him. The giant, on numerous occasions was a huge contributor to victory and he will not be forgotten. Can't say I was upset that the hounds did not go hungry :) I think everyone, and I mean absolutely everyone, can agree that this episode was unreal. Episode 10 --------------- Man, what an amazing episode. I think this is the best season finale the series has had so far. The second last episode was always very climactic, but the season finales usually just tied up a few loose ends. This one did indeed tie up some loose ends as well, but in a much more grandiose manner. Cersei just blew everyone up, and I would not have seen that from a million miles away. It was so exciting! The faith is entirely gone, and only the crown is left to rule. The music and tone accompanying this turn of events was very quite, relaxing, but not gloomy at all so it was hard to anticipate what was going to happen. The computer graphics, and the way the kid lured a member of the faith to the underground chambers was perfect. Everything progressed at a very good pace and the finale did not disappoint. I also can't believe Toman was so broken by the explosion that he decided to take his own lice. Cersei and Jamie have nothing to live for anymore, so I can't really tell where their story is going to progress. The Lannisters and Baratheon no longer have any throne (though I guess Jamie is still young enough to marry), and the opposing forces, with much more rightful kings and queens are on their way with very strong armies. Daenerys and Tyrion are doing their thing while developing a close relationship. I'm glad they're finally on a ship and ready to sail to the 7 kingdoms. John Snow. John Stark? John Targaryen? A man who dwindles in both and ice. The king of the North. The keeper of the wall? An all around general badass. He's finally getting the respect he deserves. My only concern is why Sansa wasn't happy when she saw him getting support from everyone else. After all, she herself said that she sees him as a Stark, but did her mind change? Did she imagine herself by Littlefinger's side sitting on the iron throne? I really hope they don't turn on each other. Amazing season that far exceeded any expectations I had, which were pretty high to start with."
6,5.0,"This is the best TV series, I have seen. It has the feel of big budget movie in a weekly series. Great story,Very good to great acting. Action, Drama, Suspense, I just love this show...."
6,5.0,"One of the best Season Openers - setting the table for what's to come with half of our main characters. [SPOILERS] (literally setting Jon Snow's corpse on the table, as many viewers have pointed out...xDD)"
6,4.5,"Or course, I have faith that GoT's will be wonderful this season. But my faith faltered a bit after watching the first episode of this season. It was like watching a long-legged spider - all legs with little body. Are there too many stories to tell one well? Just when I get frothy over one character they flip to another and I never feel satiated."

6,1.5,Mediocre at best. So many inconstancy's and dues ex Tarth. This episode made me physically ill.
6,4.5,A strong season opener that lines up about every storyline for the season.
6,5.0,"Best season yet,, what an amazing premier episode."
6,4.0,"83% This is my least favourite season thus far, all due to the fact that GoT is becoming increasingly predictable and I am quite sure that I will not be able to love the show the way I did. The only terrific episode of the season is The Door, the fifth episode. Though the last two episodes of the season are good, they are predictable to an extend."
6,2.5,This premier episode for Season 6 was like a spit in the face
6,5.0,A strange twist makes the episode.
6,2.5,"The episode felt like an armature fan fiction of A song of ice and fire instead of the continuation of it. There were just so many scenes, so many moments where I knew I could write a better one, and what hurts is I never felt that when reading the books or watching the show up to this point, I always felt that what was happening took extreme talent, passion and love to do, a passion that George R.R. Martin so clearly had and the current writer and director don't. I hope that this is not a bad omen for what's to come for season 6, a truly do, but as of now, any hope I had for the shows world to be on par with the books is lost."
6,5.0,Can't wait to see it tonight!
6,4.5,"A spectacular season that deftly balances character, storytelling, and violence. The best Game of Thrones has ever been."
6,5.0,"In what is easily the show's best season, Game of Thrones picks up the pace in Season 6. Packed full of fantastic choreography, cinematography and dialogue, Season 6 contains some of the series' best episodes (noteably 'The Door' and 'Battle of the Bastards'), and continues to deliver spectacular television."
6,4.5,"Seasons 1 and 2 were good, and set up the story for some great development in Season 3. Unfortunately, Seasons 3 and 4 drifted somewhat. Season 5 gets us back on track and Season 6 propels the story forward in a big way. Season 6 is the best of the lot."
6,5.0,Super excited for this!!
6,1.5,No. Just No. Overrated.
6,5.0,consistently the best show on TV!
6,5.0,April can't get here fast enough
6,4.5,"The season 6 of the fantastic show of G.O.T starts slow but then gains pace as it starts gaining it loses some of its characters development, however with that said this season is the true midpoint of the show as it reflects on the past, but at the same time looks into the future with hope of a fantastic ending worthy of the show."
6,4.5,Game of Thrones is very compelling and terribly unpredictable.
6,5.0,"After a disappointing 5th series last year, I was hoping for a bit more energy and tying-up of storylines (especially after the finale). This series did not hold back anything at all or disappoint in the slightest: Dany is finally (FINALLY) on her way to Westeros with her band of dragons, Cersei is pretty much Emperor Palpatine at this point and Jon Snow is the Jesus of the North. Absolutely nothing to fault here, and the last two episodes are nothing short of masterful. This makes me sad now that there's only two short series left until the end. Double thumbs up!"
6,5.0,Sweet mother of Winter is Here & Jon is the King
6,2.0,"too slow, too long, almost boring"
6,4.5,"Driven by its undaunted drama, bloody-epic sequences and mysticism Game of Thrones Season 6 rises back up from its slump. The acclaimed series continues (and this time, with unknown factors of its unpublished canon) with sheer complexity and allure making for one its most revered seasons in the series. 4.5/5"
7,4.0,"I remember when I first watched it that this was the last ""good"" season with 8 ruining everything. Now, on re-watch, this season was a bit bland with a few high drama moments, but also with a lot of logical flaws (telporting) etc. Still very enjoyable."
7,4.5,Awesome season!!!!!!!
7,4.0,Eu acho que começou a piorar um pouco mais isso não é algo que destrói a experiência
7,5.0,"Seja a Batalha dos Bastardos ou o Casamento Vermelho, ""Game of Thrones"" proporcionou alguns dos momentos mais icônicos da história da televisão."
7,3.5,"Absolutely rushed, and starts to ruin the quality of Game of Thrones"
7,3.5,It could much better with bigger number of episodes and more content.
7,5.0,We were well rewarded this season she is great and the character Daenerys Targaryen is having great development
7,4.0,awesome but had to few episodes shoukd have stayed with format of 10 episodes each - Rushed
7,5.0,The seventh season of Game of Thrones continues to be incredible! The visuals are better than ever and the action scenes are stunning as well. The suspense continues to build for the final season.
7,3.0,"What made this show great was the way they handled politics, the great plots, and the fact you never knew what would happen next. Every character had their motives and made decisions that felt real and according to their personal goals. Suddenly plot holes and dumb and senseless decisions happen everywhere. Plot armor becomes a HUGE thing, and characters do things out of character. Its far from a terrible show but I think it lost its essence and now just feels way more like a generic medieval show."
7,3.5,"While still being good, the show experiences a significant drop in its writing this season, and the departure from source material is seen in how time passes in the show."
7,5.0,"I loved this season. I hear a lot of people complaining, but if you really watched this show you know the writing was never perfect. None of the plot lines screamed logical from the beginning, so where is all of this GOT purist grand standing coming from? I do not know, but to me, this season is one of the best visually and I feel they did a good job of starting to wrap up the series. Yes, they could have just ran 10 episodes and closed it out completely, but they didn't, and I'm thankful for what we got. Greatest Series of all time."
7,1.0,"The begining of the downfall of the series. Rushed episodes, too dark to watch many scenes and left you longing they took the time like in initial seasons"
7,4.5,Shorter but still another epic season with great action scenes.
7,2.5,Writing : 5/10 Acting : 7/10 Cinematography : 8/10 Costume design : 8/10 Set design : 9/10 CGI Effects 9/10 Artistic vision 5/10 Adaptation ranking : 2/10
7,4.0,"Pretty cool season, worse than season 5 or 6 but still a great one!"
7,4.0,"Definitely should've had 10 episodes as intended for all seasons. Still good but wish had more episodes. An overarching threat is coming to Westeros, and ended on a good cliffhanger."
7,4.0,Epic showing of acting and talent
7,5.0,Another great season !!
7,4.5,9/10. I think this season was fantastic overall. They are closing in on the finish and character development seemingly has reached its max aside from Danny. I wish they focused on her a little more because her character was shifting to the desire of dominance quickly and without reason.
7,4.0,Winter is almost finally here... after 7 seasons
7,4.0,"This is were the show start to decline, with some no sense stuff."
7,4.0,"After a year-long wait, Game of Thrones roars back with powerful storytelling and a focused interest in its central characters -- particularly the female ones."
7,3.5,"I felt that the story lost a lot of steam. It still felt worthwhile watching and hence 3,5 stars, it definitely had moments i loved. But the season could have explored so much more."
7,4.0,"The penultimate season has moments of rush and some illocical aspects, but still gets mostly away with it thanks to assured storytelling and braavos character development, allowing its visuals, battle sequences and many surprises to stick out even more."
7,3.5,"It was rocky to me, not the best season of GOT, of all 7 this one was a week one"
7,2.0,Rushed it should have been 10 episodes
7,5.0,Just seeing all the characters come together made this season truly something special to watch!
7,3.0,"Silly, rushed and terrible writing."
7,5.0,Incredible - the high point of an already spectacular show.
7,2.0,"GoT officially dies here. Thrilling visuals just cannot replace the heart, soul, and brain that the show has lost. It is painful to watch this zombified husk of a beloved series get puppetted around."
7,1.5,"Well, at least the showrunners realized their ideas were not that great, so they condensed the season down to only seven episodes. The only problem is that it didn't help. As the hype and the budget grew to ever more ridiculous heights (supposedly $10 million per episode), the set pieces got bigger and the CGI flashier. But all that is only a smokescreen for the poor writing. The dialogue is even worse than in Season 6, the characters make dumb choices all the time, just as an excuse for the writers for things to happen. The actors try their best, but what can you do if you only get poor material to work with and your character is supposed to behave completely out of character most of the time. What a shame! There are still some impressive visuals though."
7,3.0,"It was too rushed and too condensed. David and Dan clearly don't want to do the series anymore so I'm at a lost as to why they don't concede to everyone's wished, including HBO and Martin, the writer, to pass the show to different showrunners who want to actually to make the series. This seems to be about 15 episodes of material condensed into 7 poorly written episodes."
7,1.0,"The worst season, even worse than season 8"
7,3.5,Could be better - still good but as awesome as the first four seasons.
7,1.5,"Anyone who says the endin discounting the horribly written tripe that preceded it. It's painfully obvious that this once brilliant show, is now floundering in agonizing death throes. If you've haven't gone this far, stop."
7,2.0,I don't follow the character motivation in this season. Plot seems to have holes in it.
7,1.5,The second half of this season began the worst downturn of a show in television history. They should have fired the showrunners during this season. Once they had creative control it all went downhill.
7,0.5,derailed; shame on the showrunners
7,3.0,"I truly held out hope with this season that the issues in the previous would only partially be acknowledged, and addressed accordingly in the next season.. Without that pointless hope, this season again proves to be a great execution of set design, acting, and editing, without any proper backing from the writing and screenwriting. Season 6 holds some of the highest highs up to this point, as well as some of the lowest lows. Buckle up, because the train of disappointment has many stops from here on out."
7,5.0,"Few series quite as perfect as this one. Just one thing,,,,did winter ever really come?"
7,5.0,Absolutely brilliant loved it the mix of medieval theme and fantasy and white walkers horror it's brilliant and love it and the battle Sean's are amazing and brings the horror of battle to life like I've never seen before on a historical battlefields and dialogue all great
7,5.0,I eagerly wait jon Dany meet !!!
7,3.0,"Season seven was a fine season that was made much worse by an awful season eight, which makes some decisions made in season seven much, much more dreadful."
7,4.0,Fantastic season of Game of Thrones
7,5.0,este show llega con una narracion poderosa y un interes por lo que les pasara a sus personajes centrales
7,5.0,Political science students will love it. Students of physics: stay away
7,4.5,This is where the show starts to fall of for me sadly.
7,4.0,My rating for the s7 is a 8.8/10
7,3.5,"Far from the best of the show; but not bad, and unlike previous seasons, this one is more balanced in the sense that everyone's story is of equal quality. Though things did feel a little boring and both events and characters started to feel a bit a dime a dozen."
7,5.0,"For most Fans GoT ended with this showdown with nightking, it was an great end."
7,1.5,This season was the begging of the end. The previous 6 seasons were amazing then this season just fell flat and felt rushed.
7,3.0,What happened? This series was going really well...
7,5.0,it ruined the ending but up untill season 8 it was easily one of the best shows ever made:)
7,3.0,maybe the dumbest episode of all time in this season (episode 6) terrible writing only saved by a few cool scenes
7,4.0,"Low quality script compared to the previous seasons, but I think it was a good job."
7,3.5,Start of all the issues. But still not bad taken as a whole
7,3.0,"Far more often than I'd like, I recall how much I liked this show and how mistreated it was in its final seasons. Today I decided to look up reviews for the season to see what others thought, and was shocked how positive it was. Maybe I'm holding it to too high of a bar, but the writing in this season reeaally slipped. There were signs in season 6, and 8 obviously is a catastrophe, but this season was when it became clear that all hope was lost."
7,4.5,"The penultimate season has moments of rush and some illocical aspects, but still gets mostly away with it thanks to assured storytelling and braavos character development, allowing its visuals, battle sequences and many surprises to stick out even more."
7,2.5,This is when it started going downhill
7,3.5,"É incrível como os produtores conseguiram deixar a série pior a cada temporada mesmo tendo um grande orçamento. Os diálogos estão ficando cada vez menores e com menos enriquecimento, sem contar que os personagens estão ficando cada vez mais sem aprofundamento, tudo ficando mais ""jogado"". Mas mesmo assim conseguiu ainda ser uma boa temporada, mas poderia ser bem melhor."
7,3.0,"Far less clever than previous seasons, as the showrunners continually opted for spectacle over logic. While this spectacle was indeed spectacular, the most intelligent characters (eg. Tyrion, Varys) often got lost in it."
7,4.0,"Having recently rewatched GoT from start-to-finish, I was pleasantly surprised at how much I liked Season 7 on the second occasion. There were some glaringly obvious flaws/changes in dialogue due to D&D running out of book material, but it was still an entertaining season with plenty of twists and turns. The good made up for the bad in Season 7 in my opinion so while it was far from perfect, it was still wholly memorable. While it certainly wasn't prime GoT, it still very much felt like the show that we came to love so dearly. If you're new to GoT and have just taken it up, I highly suggest you either stop here or at the end of the second episode of Season 8. At least you'll be able to remember GoT fondly. Go any further and all you'll find is anger and disappointment. Still, to this day, I will never forgive D&D for what they did to this show and even worse, the cast that deserved so much more and did the best they could with zero support."
7,4.5,Epic though a briefer Season with some amazing twists
7,5.0,esta temporada es totalmente asombrosa con violencia
7,3.0,"This is where things stopped making sense - with Gendry Storm, the roadrunner of Westeros, with a million deus ex machinas and plot conveniences galore."
7,1.5,The writing is on the wall. This show is taking a nose dive. Too bad because it was soooo good. All I'll remember is the crappy last couple of seasons.
7,3.5,"Satisfying conclusions make up for the lack of good dialogue from D&D. While to some this season might seem weak, I must say I expected less going in. But to my surprise, it was pretty solid. On to season 8! Weep."
7,3.5,"After 6 good seasons of GoT this one occured. It's still nice, but the dialogues lack the personality of the characters, the story arc gets stereotypical and rushed. Still great episodes or scenes, the finale was great! But episode 6 was so bad with the story. Too many resuces in last second and weird decisions that doesn't fit the characters. But great tension, great build up for the final season, great scene settings and acting."
7,1.0,Won't give it half a star like the last season but still pretty trash.
7,2.5,"Incredible show, at least till it follows the books. After it surpasses the books, problems start. Last season is best not mentioned."
7,2.0,Felt like setup for the next season but still entertaining. Spoilerish: Revealed something that I don't like
7,3.5,"The season starts out as a relatively well. The plot progresses faster than ever but it still works for the most part. After the first half though, much falls apart. The writing becomes very contrived, and the show makes use of the cheap tension building and false drama that it critiqued in its earlier seasons. Considering that the show has trained the viewer to expect the characters to die in dire situations it is incredibly jarring to see the amount of ""plot armor"" they have in the final episodes."
7,3.5,"Granted the quality in the rich dialogues and writing that once made Game of Thrones great is now gone, the show makes up to it by having stunning visuals accompanied by great cinematography."
7,3.5,"This season exchanges subtle plot progression for bombastic momentum. It's entertaining, but at what cost?"
7,3.0,Season 7 was just okay. You could already feel that D&D didn't care anymore. A great show that was ruined by lazy writing.
7,4.5,This Season is most important and reveals the suspense after a great setup and time. The faceoff between Jon and team and White walkers was great to watch .. One of the best episodes made.
7,3.5,"Not as good as previous seasons, but still very entertaining. For me, it doesn't pick up until the halfway mark, and Euron is by far one of the most disappointing characters for me. Anytime he is shown on screen is a negative to me."
7,2.0,"The seventh season isn't based on any of the ASOIAF books. Disappointing season. Yet another huge step back in the series. They could've used the source materials more, but the end result is still entertaining if frustrating, thanks to great actors, visual eye-candy, and score."
7,5.0,"This season continues to keep the quality of the previous seasons and keeps the level of the show as one of the best ever made, with an amazing cliffhanger at the end of the last episode."
7,5.0,Brilliant show bro 👍
7,5.0,"Uma temporada que também foi mais curta e acelerada, mas que trouxe grandes momentos de Game of Thrones. A escala das batalhas foi grandiosa, e a série ganhou pulso ao trazer mais presença do Rei da Noite e os Caminhantes Brancos, mas também representou a decaída em roteiro da produção. E a sexta melhor temporada de Game of Throres!"
7,1.5,it was a nice show at the beginning... gone bad already
7,4.5,This season takes a lot of risks that work phenomenally well.
7,5.0,Season 7 continues to give rewards to the long suffering of fans along the years.
7,5.0,"An amazing season with the White Walkers at the best they've ever been, and the season that wraps up a lot of the missing pieces."
7,5.0,stop watching at the end of this season ! the last one will just ruin the whole show.
7,5.0,"The best show ever by far, this season is one of the best despite what some people say I just wish there were more episodes !!!"
7,1.0,"The writing is so bad, what a waste of an excellent series."
7,3.5,"This season's still pretty good, yet not as good as the previous ones, though. I mean, the special effects and the CGI are awesome, and the story continues to be very interesting. However, the big problem is the writting, because the relantionship between some characters is not well developed and there are a few plot holes that don't make sense at all. Also, the protagonism of some characters gives them handicap and it looks like forced because the script needs them, and this show is exactly the opposite of that."
7,0.5,A crime against showmaking.
7,0.5,Absolutely a completely horrible season that led into the worse season of any TV show ever
7,2.5,This was the beginning of the race to the bottom.
7,4.0,"Things started feeling a bit wrong here, but it was still good and nothing to do with the disastrous season 8. Such a shame season 8 had to happen the way it did:(("
7,3.0,This show is lost without the books. Started feeling more like a CW show set in the GoT universe.
7,4.5,Game of Thrones Season 7 | Detailed note: 8.9
7,0.5,Most overrated show of all time I was waiting for some character or even just some welly filmed action but never got either in all of these seasons
7,3.5,"Not as good as previous seasons, but way better than Season 8. However, Season 7 marks the beginning of the downfall of GOT. The timing/pacing in Season 7 makes absolutely no sense in regard to the rest of the series - you can tell the directors/writers are trying to speed things up to finish the series. If you've watched all seasons up to this point, you can stop now because there's nothing left worth seeing."
7,4.0,"it may be great for diehard fans, i liked the outcome and tension build up, but this is the last time we will have any good from the franchise"
7,5.0,"Is it really wasted time when it gives me pure joy??? #gameofthrones When I first saw the trailers of Game of Thrones, although it seemed interesting and looked like something I would enjoy but a period piece, dirty looking people with blood stains seemed depressing and I wasn't feeling it at that time. The show became unstoppable at Season 3. Naturally, the more it got popular, the more I got hesitant to ""follow the trend"" but curious what is all this fuzz about. And one day I decided to start. I couldn't keep my eyes away since I started episode 1… I binged all 3 seasons in one long weekend. After that, for the whole week, day and night, I was thinking of GoT GoT GoT, I talked about it to everyone I met. Season 1 has familiar lead actors faces, thought oh the main guys. it will be about them and they will save the world at the end of the show… As an avid TV watcher, I can guess most shows what direction they will go and I'd like to think I am mostly right. But then totally crushed my theories on this. Anyway, end of season 1, I guessed Big guys are not the main guys but Okay.., there are plenty of actors to go around and stories to go on.. YES, it was just the beginning. LESSON LEARNED: Being good and righteous is not always a good thing. Season 2 Like everybody else, I am very fond of the ""imp"" but I know he can't be the MAIN guy, u know.. I also started to love another character and decided ah! This is THE guy.. he's IT! This series is about him and how he conquers the Throne.. I enjoyed all the characters and storyline but I have picked my favorite. LESSON LEARNED: Makes alliances, they are very useful and may even safe your life. Season 3 WHAT! Was I wrong!!!.... How could they ! All hope is lost and I am left like not sure if I like this show… Do I even want to keep watching it? My timing was not bad because only a few months later, Season 4 is on and of course I kept my obsession. LESSON LEARNED: Keep your promise at any cost, or else… Season 4 Just found another ""hopeful"" guy but before the season end, my dream was crushed again ugh! It is getting harder to pick the MAIN guy because 1) they don't stick around 2) I believe in all those different plots and each character leading their plot… Even the Villains.. so good at their jobs, I LOVE to hate them. I only keep looking for the MAIN guy because, we always knew who the MAIN girl is from the beginning. LESSON LEARNED: Trust No one, especially in the season of back-stabbing. Season 5 Soooo bored by the religious group storyline. At this point I have my full faith on the creators and I know this all have a good reason to be there but I was just simply pure dislike and bored. And enough with that ""No-one"" business!. The biggest part, the TRICKERY!!! …, I feel like all hope is lost AGAIN and no point to continue.. And yet, I went back… LESSON LEARNED: Karma returns in the same form, Shame! Shame! Shame! … Season 6 Hope is NOT lost after all… This is the season of revenge by the group of lead characters. It is very satisfying to see all those who wins. And to think after hanging out with a wilding for years, the boy would learn something about survival… LESSON LEARNED: Revenge is sometimes an absolute necessity. And who runs the world? (GIRLS!) After my endless obsession, and pleadings My bff agreed to watch GoT in the summer of 2017. We binged the series within a couple of weekends (My 2nd time), before Season 7 aired. Season 7 Too much information all cramped up in each episode. My anxiety took the better of me and as I watched live, I was too excited to grasp all the details from the episodes. Ed Sheeran guest starring doesn't help at all. It is too good to complain about the weird fast forwarded timeline, like many I noticed it and like many I chose to ignore it. Only one complain here, I can't feel the chemistry between ""those two"". I feel like even Brianne and the Hound had it way better. LESSON LEARNED: Never take anyone for granted. Even your children can be turned against you at any time. Everyone who watch the show would at least say oh this is interesting. After 1st watch My bff said ""the show is ok, I like it"". As we are doing this countdown (Her 2nd time)... I asked ""now, u really like the show, right"" ... replied "" I LOVE it!!!"". First, my thought was I'm cool for watching it, then I feel like a looser obsessing over something that everyone else is. First time was harder to process for me because of the names and similar knight outfits. Second time was when I got a complete picture. Now, after watching it for the 3rd time, I am just sooo damn pleased and satisfied (အရမ္းေက်နပ္တယ္) to have found something I thoroughly enjoy. The countdown-watch reminded us what we've forgotten and also feel more appreciative of the plot planted from the very beginning for each character. This show gave obvious favorites and then took them away, but I think it was created so cleverly to make it impossible to root for a favorite because you are rooting for every single character. If you watched the show and enjoyed it, I HIGHLY recommend to watch it again. For the love of Game of Thrones, (probably for it alone), I no longer feel weird out to belong with the crowd. Now, I am A proud follower of the craze, A waste-r of time, A comrade of the enthusiasts, A confidant of theories, and An advocate of devotees. Do I need to spend all this time to write about it this long? I enjoy Game of Thrones, I enjoy writing, and I really enjoy writing about Game of Thrones. Would YOU call it a wasted time when it gives you pure joy to do something you truly love???"
7,2.5,"this season was also horrible compared to all previous ones update after 6th rewatch? : 1-6 are still masterpieces to binge everytime. Many hate season 8 only but holy fucking shit, Season7 is so fucking bad as well... Like what the actual fuck. - Couldn't watch it again"
7,5.0,"Even if u hated the ending this is by far the greatest show of all time. Each episode keeps u on the edge of your seat. Never have i ever heard as many people talk about whats gunna happen next week. There was just a lot of people upset because they didn't get what they want but that is what the whole show was, you never got what u want.."
7,4.0,"Winter is Here in Game of Thrones Season 7, the season did a very good job at having a main focus due to the non-use of the novels. The season was quite rushed but it did a great job telling us the story. It does mess with some character arcs but that is only a minor nit-pick. The season sets up perfectly for the war against the White Walkers."
7,3.0,Ya muestra algunos problemas que iban a agudizarse en la última temporada pero todavía fue disfrutable.
7,5.0,Craziest season yet not the greatest like season 4 & 6!4th episode was awesome spectical to watch then came craziest thing ever episode 6 were dragon was killed i was literally blown and at the end u know what happenend wuth wall!wow
7,5.0,Unparalleled in its awe-inspiring visual beauty and in its unprecedented grand storytelling. 9.9/10
7,2.0,"The worthless build up and the stalling of character arcs in the 6th and 7th season ruined the show and people overreacted only in the 8th season. This season didn't plan the long game but only gave temporary thrills, which was lazy writing by the creators, who no longer had the support of the books."
7,4.5,You can tell they weren't going off of the book since this season was more focused on action rather than dialogue. It seemed a bit slow but it was still very interesting but I feel like it was jumping to conclusions way too fast. Also Littlefinger's death didn't seem necessary in this season.
7,2.5,It was visually stunning but way too many plot holes for me to really enjoy.
7,2.0,"Well, even after having watched Season 8 - I still believe ""Beyond the Wall"" is the stupidest Episode of anything I`ve ever witnessed. The hole storyline leading to that painful climax still makes me cringe in disbelieve. Although all in all S7 is not as messed up as it`s successor, it is a sign what was about to follow as big as a brick - that is attempting to knock your intelligence out of your brain."
7,3.5,"Similar to the previous season, it looked great, the actors did amazing, but the story took a back seat to the action. The political intrigue pretty much disappeared, replaced by ""teleporting"" characters to be where the plot needs them to be, ignoring travel distances, and for the first time in the show existence, we start seeing ""plot armor"". People survive stuff just because they are developed characters, and from time to time we get served a ""sacrificial offering"", without it really being all about people's chances to survive an encounter but more like ""ok we haven't killed any character in quite a few episode, let's see who goes""."
7,2.5,"A bad GOT season, filled with embarassing and bombastic moments. But the next will be even worse."
7,4.0,"It honestly didn't feel like Game of Thrones in the sense of characters beginning to make decisions based on hitting plot points rather than what feels natural according to their past history. Some characters also have been dumbed down and given the teleportation ability to continuously progress the story. Those critiques aside, I still thoroughly enjoyed this season featuring some great reunions, acting, visuals, score, and also my second favorite battle sequence of the series. It may not be Game of Thrones, but it's still great tv!"
7,3.0,"The beginning of the end. Great writing and pacing thrown to the sidelines for cheap thrills and ""wow"" moments."
7,0.5,"Oh boy, what happened? This was the best show going for 7 seasons but the ending to this series was brutal. I don't know what the writers were thinking.... I bet Harington wasn't too happy either haha... Honestly I would like to see this last season scrubbed and redone properly with new writers if possible"
7,3.5,"This season started showing major cracks in the show. Storytelling, pacing, tension, stress, and even the focus of the show began to drift further and further from what was the original tone of the show. Good visuals and an exciting watch, just not as engrossing as what the show once was."
7,3.5,"By the end of this season, I was only hanging on for absolutely everything besides the writing. The direction, cinematography, costumes, acting, set design, special effects... it's all glorious. It's worth watching in spite of how poor decisions are starting to snowball. Characters are becoming inconsistent and illogically written, the story is starting to feel very rushed."
7,2.0,The Game of Thrones finally drowned in itself any signs of common sense that could still be found last season. Only negative feelings are born in me when I see how the series breaks up with itself.
7,4.5,"It's mostly setup for the final showdown, sure, but it still does a lot of things that fans have been waiting for since the beginning. It also still has plenty of blood, action, and betrayal. (A-)"
7,0.5,"The story of the game of thrones is fake, wrong and family destroying. full of sad scenes like rape, killing innocent people, adult parts. all the people slept together.!!! Too bad"
7,2.5,"Not as bad as the final season, but not good."
7,1.5,"A WEAK ENDING - Didn't do justice to the cast, felt rushed."
7,5.0,"the series is the best, but the end is good"
7,3.0,"Season 7 is truncated, and this is where the show particularly begins to feel rushed. There are spectacular scenes and the soundtrack is brilliant as always, but the show is a far cry from what it was during seasons 1-4."
7,4.0,Everyone's opinions get into my head so I don't know what I think Actually I do but TOO MANY PEOPLE HAVE OPINIONS SO NO ONE CARES sigh Anyways If I were to rate this season as part of the fine show it is Then like It trash But like At some point my expectations (due to criticism) adjust So I watched this like it was just a Marvel movie or something So on that level I quite enjoyed this (Do i day I don't care anymore? Yea at this point I didn't care) MAY I JUST SAY DAENERYS'S COSTUMES ARE THE GREATEST THING TO EVER GRACE MY WORLD speaking of costumes why did Jon just like wear his cloak in the south- *inhale* oh its rant time *i will not rant* dudefellintoicewaterandwascarriedunconsciousonhorsebackthroughmilesofsnowandliketheydrapedafuroverhislegsandnowhesfinelikeicallbullshit Right whatever Daenerys looked cool
7,2.0,Season 7 was the beginning of the end. It was just the lead up to the disaster that was season 8.
7,3.5,"Not as good as previous seasons, but not as bad as what's to come next"
7,4.0,Not as good as the previous season but still a great show and worth watching. Amazing action and characters. Focuses mainly on Daenerys.
7,4.0,"As we approach the end, Game of Thrones delivers everything the fans want. The continue to deliver strong storytelling, amazing character arcs, beautiful sets and environment, and one major baddie. Westeros has one hell of a war ahead of them, the dead march, the living fall, the long night is coming."
7,4.0,muy buena esta temporada jon nieve y madre de dragones no me lo esperaba sorpresa a fina de esta temporada
7,5.0,Exiting! I love this show.
7,1.5,"This is objectively the second worst season of GOT (season 8 being objectively the worst). If you disagree you are wrong as this is not an opinion it is a fact. There are so many flaws with the last few seasons it is tragic when they had such a solid TV show seasons 1-4. GOT has deviated from the book since the beginning but with no book to steal a plot outline from the writers screw the plot even more than they did in seasons 5 & 6. I would highly recommend watching only seasons 1-4 because everything after that is a massive downgrade, especially seasons 7 & 8. Character arcs are ruined in this season (such as Tyrion becoming a moron when he was originally an intelligent character), the whole season is rushed (because there are fewer episodes than previous seasons and characters literally teleport in the world), nothing like what the book plot will be once it's released (the book will be better), and there were lots of stupid unrealistic storylines (such as the Sansa, Arya, and Bran against Little Finger and the trip to catch a wight). The writers butchered the TV show"
7,4.0,"Season 7, while still really great and enjoyable television, had a lot of things that took viewers out of the escapism. It had things that made no sense with the logistics that they has already set up in the world. This season is still pretty solid in terms of quality, and definitely a pretty good fantasy adaptation, but a lot of the major problems from season 8 were foreshadowed here."
7,3.5,"It was good, but too short and was definitely lacking something all the previous seasons had."
7,3.5,"Overall this was a good season, although it was easily the weakest Thrones had to offer at the time."
7,1.0,"I'm just shocked at how people brought the crap that Season 7 put out. Perhaps it wasn't noticeable enough because Season 6 didn't go as badly as Season 5 did, but holy sh** was Season 7 a mess."
7,4.5,"It is clear that the writing has suffered from not being adapted from the books and certain characters seem to be losing certain logic. But, it does feel like everything is coming together and the final two episodes, albeit rushed, were immensely enjoyable."
7,3.5,"Logic has left the building in game of thrones, characters ""teleport"" and the season feels rushed, there are episodes like 1,2,3 and 4 that are very well done and then there's episode 6 that has absolutely no logic, the final episode is ok with a promising ending and characters are back to normal-ish with vile villains and heroic heroes and the normal twists and turns you should expect from game of thrones."
7,5.0,"The story's Third Act begins here (and the pace is accordingly accelerated) with its many story lines and characters converging towards a climax. Every episode was wonderful, especially 4 (one of the best of the show) and 7, with 5 being the only one that jarred a little as the story moves noticeably swifter (still a great episode). I loved it."
7,4.0,"Season 7 did not live up to the expected standard. It was clear the writing was struggling to maintain it's previous levels of pace, logic and character development. I thought I'd give the falling standard of the writing the benefit of the doubt, that there were a lot of characters to get into position for the end game so maybe everything had to be rushed in Season 7 to bring the show to a satisfying conclusion in Season 8. Instead it was just another Lost."
7,3.5,"Still good, but you really start to see the writing deteriorate in a few of the episodes near the end of this season when they had completely exhausted the exiting source material (the book series is unfinished). The Wight Hunt episode is a particularly great example of how D.B. Weiss and David Benioff can't write for shit."
7,3.0,"The series was rushed in my opinion. Overall, satisfactory rating"
7,3.5,what made GOT of thrones so good is that anyone can be offed at any time. We now some that the best defense is Plot Armor.
7,3.0,"As with Season 6, the show continues to disappoint me compared to the earlier seasons. A couple of the characters' storylines seem practically pointless, and the show seems a little confused about the direction it's going."
7,3.0,it really went bad the logic just was not their the plot armour was 2 thick
7,5.0,"Even though this season wasn't as good as previous seasons it was still another A+ to me. Lead acting this season was outstanding especially from Emilia Clarke, Maisie Williams, Peter Dinklage, Lena Headey, Sophie Turner, Kit Harington, Nikolaj Coster-Waldau, Pilou Asbæk, Gwendoline Christie, Jerome Flynn, John Bradley, and Kristofer Hivju. Supporting acting the season was excellent especially from Diana Rigg, Rory McCann, Iain Glen, Isaac Hempstead Wright, Aidan Gillen, Liam Cunningham, Alfie Allen, and Bella Ramsey. This season the battles and fights were phenomenal especially the battle between the Lannister army against Daenerys, Drogon, and the Dothraki, the battle between Jon Snow, Tormund Giantsbane, The Hound, The Brotherhood, Daenerys, Drogon, Rhaegal, and Viserion against the undead wights, and the fight training between Brienne and Arya. This season the visual effects were remarkable especially undead Viserion wight, undead Snow Bear, Drogon, and Daenerys riding on Drogon. The costumes this season were terrific especially Lena Headey's costumes, Emilia Clarke's costumes, and Kit Harington's costumes. The storytelling and writing were wonderful this season. The makeup effects were great this season especially on the undead Giant wight and Jorah's Greyscales. The music was great in this season. Also the last scene was really cool. Game of Thrones is still my 2nd favorite tv show of all time."
7,0.5,Quality goes downhill fast story/plot/writing wise.
7,0.5,Ending ruins everything funny waste your time
7,0.5,"The story is spaghetti now, but the effects are glorious."
7,1.0,No chemistry between Dany and Jon. This is the season the writing goes off the rails. sad.
7,5.0,"Brilliant until szn 8 throws out the characters, the plot, the whole theme of the show, along with logic, humor, and everything else good."
7,3.5,"7/10 GOT started to have issues with story time, distances and logic"
7,3.0,"Nice, they are gonne need to explain a lot in season 8 tho."
7,3.5,"Still one of the best shows on TV. Things seemed to move super fast but all in all I was satisfied with this season. Great acting, set pieces, and special effects"
7,0.5,here it starts all that went wrong and we find in the end of 8th seasons.
7,1.0,This is when the show started to pass it's use by date.
7,5.0,"Rapid pace, but still an amazing show."
7,0.5,Weak season with characters getting dumber each episode
7,5.0,In my opinion this is a very good season which opens a lot of possibilites and episodes to see in the next one.
7,1.5,"There was no gripping factors this season; only frustration by D+D depending too much on viewers catching the subtext of actions and conversations to understand what was going on. They destroyed a once sly and cunning character by making him an idiot. Nice going, Dumb and Dumber. The logistics exercised in the previous seasons went completely out the window with characters teleporting from one location to the next; Varys was a major example."
7,3.0,"This is the point where the show really starts to go down hill. The characters appear to make decisions that just seem off? Like the villans start to peak around corners with an evil smile ( think of pink panther). But in season 1-5, it was hard to determine who the villans were and if you knew, it was hard to figure out exactly what they were up to."
7,3.5,"Action packed and some of the best action in the series so far. The short season hurts the overall storytelling arc and plot are accelerated, not for the better though."
7,3.0,this is the season where it started getting visibly weird for me but it was still a good season cause they had a lot of things built up till this point that would payoff in the next season... or so I thought.
7,1.5,Ð¡Ðµï¿½Â?Ð¸Ð°Ð» ï¿½Â?ï¿½Â?ï¿½Â?ÐµÐ¼Ð¸ï¿½Â?ÐµÐ»ï¿½Â?Ð½Ð¾ ï¿½Â?ÐºÐ°ï¿½Â?ï¿½Â?Ð²Ð°Ðµï¿½Â?ï¿½Â?ï¿½Â? Ð² Ð¿Ð¾ï¿½Â?ï¿½Â?ÐµÐ´ï¿½Â?ï¿½Â?Ð²ÐµÐ½Ð½ï¿½Â?Ð¹ ï¿½Â?Ðºï¿½Â?Ð½-Ð±Ð¾ÐµÐ²Ð¸Ðº. Ð­ï¿½Â?Ð¾ ï¿½Â?Ð»Ð¸Ð² ï¿½Â?Ð¾Ð²Ð°ï¿½Â?Ð¸ï¿½Â?Ð¸
7,2.0,thought season 5-6 is bad this is worse.
7,1.5,"Did just rewatch the first 7 seasons. the 6 before this are bulletproof and i able to watch them again and again. its not the same case for this season however, it do not live up to the GOT standards and it have to many holes in it. The showrunners decided not to wait on the book to be finish and its clearly this season does not have book to relie on. This season have more holes than the six before it combined and it leaves to many questions unanaswered. Examples on this: Jon knows Arya and Bran 2 episodes before he got the letter. dothraki rides through fire Lannisters loses and forces to retreat but managed to get the slowly goldwagon with them. Tormund knows Cersei fucks her brother. the dead suddenly have 100 meter long chains they can use to get the dragon up from the water. Unlike the 6 seasons before it, this season also contain one big plothole, about the white walkers. In the ending scene of episode 6, the white walkers goes down in the water to pick up a Rhadgar the dragons dead body, but if the white walkers can go in the water, why do they not just go in the sea, around the wall and attack the living? In this season does the characters starts flying around westeros in no time. In episode 5 does Davos start in Dragonstone, goes to Kings Landing, back to Dragonstone and ends in Eastwatch all in a half episodes time."
7,3.0,"The season has the feel of an outline linking moments and plot devices so that we can get to the end point as quickly as possible with minimal exposition, character development, or insight into this rich story world (or the characters' internal worlds). What the show does well maintains â?? production design, acting from many quarters, and an absolutely divine score. But issues that plagued the writing in previous seasons only become more glaring in this one. It's a strange kind of hubris, given the resources made available to the production."
7,1.0,A Lot of fan service and ilogical scenes. What happenned to this serie?
7,1.0,Rushed and idiotic. Great shame.
7,1.5,This season was weird.... WTF?
7,0.5,"rushed version of game of thrones, not the same as before"
7,1.5,It goes through the story beats necessary to setup the final season with a weak plot. The characters service the plot and make decisions which setup future storylines but don't make sense for the character.
7,3.5,A far too rushed season.
7,2.0,"This where the problems began for the show. Everything is rushed, wooden dialogue and nonsensical plots. Tyrion and Varys have been lobotomized and the Winterfell plot was outright unwatchable. The battles were good (Except the one in episode 6) and were one of the few saving graces of the season. The weakest season up to that point, by far."
7,0.5,"What do these guys have against Jon Snow??? I mean they did him wrong in season 6 but damn, season 7 is even worse."
7,2.0,Season 7 is ultimately the most boring and pointless season of Game Of Thrones so far. Huge amounts of time is wasted on pointless story threads. Characters suddenly change personality. The action set pease of the season makes no sense when thought about logically. It really shows that the writers no longer have the books to pull from and have to use their own ideas.
7,2.0,time is just a strange illusion
7,2.0,"en esta temporada comienza el declive de la serie, it is incomprehensible that there are good reviews about it and the worst was only to come"
7,2.5,"The writing just gets worse and worse. Lazy, logic-defying, inconsistent. It's such a shame to see these characters we love devolve into simplistic low-grade fan fiction."
7,5.0,Loved it - strong storytelling!
7,2.5,"Average season, not what we are use to see if espected from this serie"
7,3.0,A weak but still mostly enjoyable season.
7,4.0,I wish the story had been given way more time and action hadn't been so rushed.
7,2.5,"Lost all sense of scale and slowly continues the gradual decline that began in season 4. Some great moments, but the focus on battles and other spectacles is worth little when everything feels rushed, characters behave unnaturally, and the plot is contriced and predictable. This isn't the Game of Thrones I loved, it's big budget fan fiction"
7,5.0,"Beautiful, interesting and full of twists."
7,1.5,why would you do a 7 episode season 10 is allready too short a saw all season in 1week the series is not bad but just too short
7,3.0,"Somewhat disappointing. Starting off, I get that the show wanted the mimic conditions of fighting a battle in a the cold storm and darkness ""winter is comming""Or that can be an ad gif excuse for poor execution in production. There have been many battles and I got the feel for them without actually having to make black shadows out on my screen. We've waited 6 years for this and we get dark fuzzy and shaky. I'm wondering if the Blair witch cinematographers were resurrected along with the dead. I think they just messed up. So Melisandrea soul purpose was to light the swords just so we can see them go out as cinematic tension. Then to light the trench and then to die as penance for killing a child. Kinda nifty and tidy. A couple of completely ridiculous tactics. Send all your Calvary out at once ok. Get them killed ok. No pincer move got it. These are the best military commanders. The dragon sequence still was shaky dark and blurry. Kinda a waste. Drop the night king good he has one lance ok he threw it good missed great. So you fly away. He had no more lances. You fight the undead and wait for them to overtake your dragon. Bad. You stand in front of the zombie dragon and yell as your last stand dumb. Jon snow isn't really a great leader had to be saved for stupidity several times now. The big moment in the battle was to light the trench so that the dragons could see where the stronghold was but at that moment there is a clearing of the clouds kinda made that part mute. Just so happens all of the main characters are fighting in pockets alive at the end and everyone else dies. Lazy writing. The talking bad guy approach. Even though the night king didn't talk still hesitated as if to explain his dr evil mega death machine which gives aura a chance to somehow sneak past all the dead and kill the night king lazy cliche. Then my biggest gripe the hive control end game. Just kill the head baddie and all the rest will go. Getting tired of this used plot device to convienently did all bad guys in one felled swoop. Getting old. All the characters that had to be redeemed were? All of them. Theon we expected joran not so much. Overall this was a lazy rush job it got strung together cliches from other movies. It's like the movie night king raised his arms and resurrected other plot points from other movies as the last battle call got 8.3."
7,3.0,"When you have no creativity you go back to the old good vs evil with loads of CGI. The show has lost its depth all that remains is gratuitous sex, cgi, and tropes."
7,4.0,This season had quite a few weak spots but besides that it's a great season!
7,5.0,We do deserve a 2 hours episodes
7,5.0,"Finally a show without those stupid Hollywoodish, PG-13 happy endings. Something serious."
7,5.0,"This season was insane, the last and final season might just give me a heart attack!"
7,3.5,"""Death is the enemy. The first enemy, and the last."" Game of Thrones season 7 is enthralling and sweeping with excitement that every episode leaves you anticipating the next. Everything on a technical and acting standpoint is incredible, but everything else in terms of writing and story narrative feels rushed, unfortunately. With the show going off from George R. R. Martin books, it becomes more transparent that the details in characters and pacing is lacking. It's not a bad season, just messy compared to previous seasons. This review will contain spoilers for season 7. Let's start with the positives: The biggest praise I can give for a show like this is making TV cinematic, especially with episodes like ""The Spoils of War"" that is a treat for the eyes. This is the first time we've seen these dragons attack on this grand of a scale. There's only small incidents where I can recall feeling tense while watching something, but episodes like this proves the excellence of TV - same thing applies with ""Beyond the Wall"", in spite of the flaws. The first interaction between Jon and Daenerys is great. I liked how they couldn't stand each other at first with Jon refusing to knee before her and bursting Daenerys ego. I mean, we got two powerful leaders with legendary status clashing with each other. It's until later when they relationship becomes more tender and open, which would be rush in any other show, but it takes good actors to make it believable in a small amount of time. Lena Headey, Peter Dinklage, Emilia Clarke and everyone else is fantastic as usual. Nikolaj Coster-Waldau, on the other hand, I thought is really excellent this season, and in previous seasons as well. Beautifully portraying a conflicted Jaime who will make the toughest decisions in the upcoming season finale, as I'm predicting. His facial expressions says it all and I'm glad the actor is finally getting credit - long overdue. Viserion death (Daenerys dragon) was heartbreaking and made The Night King a threatening presence. You soon realize that Jon's bravery is sometimes his flaw, and the whole mission to capture a white walker to show the Lannister's who's the real enemy wasn't anything heroic, just suicide. Even when the characters reflect on their foolish decisions, it's almost similar to when Gandalf from â??Lord of the Rings' questions if the whole eagle plan was even a good strategy. The visual effects are nearly photo realistic at times, sometimes better than most blockbusters we're getting recently. The score is breathtaking and Ramin Djawadi doesn't disappoint. The cinematography with the mixture of cold blues and striking landscapes is impeccable. As I said before, everything on a technical standpoint is flawless, but what about the rest? Now for my issues: I honestly think cutting the episodes down to 7 probably wasn't the best idea, because with characters zigzagging to different locations with a certain urgency, but not once did I feel there was a pasting of time, as the whole thing felt like it took place in one day. I'm guessing characters can teleport now (not literally), but in the world of â??Game of Thrones' it doesn't sound too far fetched. Also, the whole Sansa and Arya subplot is one of the most pointless things ever. It's only purpose is tricking the audiences into thinking Arya is going to kill her own sister for some sort of revenge, which by the way, her reasoning makes no sense whatsoever. At the end it's just a trap for Littlefinger, even though there are plenty of scenes when he wasn't in the room or nearby to eavesdrop - so again, WHO ARE YOU TRYING TO TRICK BESIDES LITTLEFINGER? I didn't like how Lord Baelish 'Littlefinger' existed the show as I don't believe the sneaky and collective slimeball would've at least went out with a fight. Trial by combat wasn't an option? I'm starting to think the show itself is embracing the fandom a little, because while winter is closing in and tension is rising, the danger for the main characters feels safe with the endless amount of fake outs and convenient rescues. The bamboozle starts whenever a beloved character is facing danger up close and you think the worst will happen, but at the last minute is saved and you sigh with relief. The entire season feels like that and takes away any sort of danger in these type of situations. It's becoming fan fiction at this point. Overall rating: Despite my mixed feelings - I'm still excited for season 8. I mean, I've been watching this show from the very beginning so it wouldn't make sense for me not to be. Again, this is nowhere near a bad season, just wasn't as strong as the previous ones, mainly on re-watch."
7,5.0,Best show in the world!
7,3.0,"Oh how the mighty fall. I love Game of Thrones, but this season was an absolute mess and it shows. There is a clear lack of direction, while also rushing to get everything tied up. They've lost Georges vision and are now going down their own path with his characters, completely trampling over all the previous world building, story structure and character complexity for the sake of set piece action. Mind you, the set piece action is comparable to none and a guilty joy of mine, it's the only reason this gets rated so highly by me - a shambles of a season."
7,5.0,"Best show on tv. The writing, directing, acting is head and shoulders above everything else."
7,5.0,dragon against dragon is about to come. ice and fire. the wall isnt as strong against a dragon
7,4.0,one of the best seasons ever
7,5.0,"Great series, not as good as the earlier series as far as plot twists, but still an excellent season."
7,5.0,Captivating...... Unpredictable..... Everything you would want from an epic fantasy TV show
7,4.5,Very exciting and fun.
7,5.0,Getting close to the end! Winter is coming! As awesome as this show has been and as cool as it is to see things coming together finally its very sad to know its almost over! Greatest TV show of all times! #TheGOAT #StraightCrack
7,5.0,Best show on TV. top 3 best show of all time
7,4.0,"Game of Thrones is shorter, brisker and maybe a little more logically flawed than usual in a penultimate season that sees unlikely twists come to fruition and a tantalizing tease at the long war ahead, presented in the show's signature set piece-driven style."
7,4.0,Game of thrones is amazing. A good story and until recently up to season 5 a solis story but since season 5 its suffered and lacked. And following on from that in season 7 theres some really amazing scenes but yet at times clearly lack George rr martains brilliance in them. Examples would be little fingers story bringing ed sheeren in etc!
7,5.0,i really liked it and the very last scene with the dead dragon was phenomenal.
7,5.0,The best tv show of all time! I cant get enough of it.
7,5.0,Game of Thrones is one of the best fantasy epics brought to the screen. I would even go as far as to say it might be the first book series I have ever read that is outdone by its cinematic counterpart.
7,5.0,The books where amazing and the show is extremely engaging!
7,4.0,Season 7 delivers some of the payoff fans have been waiting for and puts the pieces in place for a spectacular final season.
7,2.5,"Disappointing season, timing and speed of characters was stupid Gendry, Daenerys, The Lannisters etc are good examples, plot armor is ridiculous Jon should be dead its outrageous how he still lives, fan service the mention of rowing, the cameos etc, the awful forced cringy Jon and Dany relationship just not convincing at all the moment when Jon bent the knee especially made me have shivers of embarrassment it was just awful, 3rd wave feminism there's no need to bash men all the time, Aryas storyline normalising her as a good person when she's clearly a psychopath that annoyed me, unnecessary dramas in winterfell they may aswell have cut Arya, Bran and Sansa from season 7 if they weren't needed their storyline was just crap, making certain characters really stupid like Littlefinger and Tyrion two of the best players aswell such a betrayal of their characters or having characters not been themselves Jon and Arya were personal highlights just so they could advance the plot aswell it's shameful, the special effects are the only amazing thing everything else was dog shi#& this season and that's why i give this a 2 and a half because for game of thrones standards this season was terrible"
7,4.5,"The most awaited and hyped season in television history doesn't disappoint and resembles more a Star Wars movie-like-event than conventional shows due to its sheer magnitude. The slow build-up in previous seasons enhances the stakes of this one and, even though its far from its peak in terms of unpredictability and plot originality, its still an amazing action movie-show."
7,5.0,This show is fucking legendary. It just is. Season 7 acted and paced beautifully keeps us waiting in agony for the final season to arrive.
7,1.5,This is what happens when you don't have book material to fall back on. Its just another drama show now just tying up loose ends.
7,5.0,Best thing on TV ever.
7,5.0,The best series in the world !
7,5.0,It had some pacing issues but its definitely worthwhile
7,3.5,With a shorter season Game of Thrones feels like its rushing to its finish line too quickly and many of its storylines are drawing to a close prematurely. While it is still entertaining this show runners have done a great disservice to the fans with season 7.
7,5.0,"Story, Cast, Acting, VFX etc every is Tremendous also Most Realistically Written Series, Realism means nothing blurred or muted or cut e.g. Sex Scenes & violence Scenes which makes it different from other TV series & Amazing & Realistic... Also High Fantasy, Kings, Queen, Wars, White Walker (Snow Monsters) & Dragons Makes it Great High fantasy TV Series... To the point & Close to the Book, This TV series is Magnificent & Excellent, I Really Liked it Rated 10/10 Regards"
7,4.5,"GOT as a whole is simply put one of the best series on this planet. Unfortunately season 7 wasn't that exciting anymore. The good is good and the evil is evil. Besides john snow has gained main character abilities, he can't die anymore... Still a good season"
7,4.5,"HBO has carefully built a reputation for producing the very best examples of television, ever. With such series as The Sopranos, Oz, and Deadwood, they have more than justified their slogan, ""Its not television, its HBO."" A recent series that has eclipsed any rivals that might hope to supplant its position strongly influencing the zeitgeist of a generation, 'Game of Thrones. In keeping with the latest trend for high end, popular series, the story was conceived and executed as a complete narrative. Rather than attempting to constantly extending the story for an until the popularity and quality declines to below the point of justifying renewal, the innovative beauty of this arrangement is the overall format of the story can follow the traditional beginning, middle and end without leaving annoying loose ends to perplex and annoy the loyal fans. This latest seventh season, the penultimate, season setting the pieces on the chess board in preparation for the long-awaited end game. During the run of the series thus far the writers have never held any trepidation with killing principle character, fan favorites that under most instances would afford them a definite degree of protection. The number of the episode was reduced to only seven forcing a faster pace than usual. The format had been established to proceed to slow, taking great care to paint a detailed picture of the proceedings and allowing ample room for the minute details to be incorporated into the character development. The result was to bring an incredible amount of exciting storytelling to the anxiously awaiting climatization of years crafting a saga of epic proportions. Based on a series of the novel but wisely did not attempt to completely mirror the during the translation to a live action production. The sensibilities and demands of a highly visual media as television are substantially different from the written page. Too many great works exhibiting literary excellence have been utterly ruined by attempting to force a style and presentation suitable for chapters in a book to the episodic medium of television. The flow of information, emotional content and the fine details necessary to properly tell the story. In this instance, the translation was nothing short of miraculous. Since the premiere episode, every aspect of this series has been performed on a grand scale. The details infused into the costumes and weapons to the staging of sets down to table utensils, jewelry and minute textures of surfaces were painstakingly recreated with determination to remain true to a pre-industrial, feudal society. Typical of a penultimate season there is plenty of action, sufficient to keep the most jaded fan of action/adventure movies satisfied. The battle scenes were immense, employing a legion of extras supported by seamless special effects. Computer-assisted creations and enhancements are commonplace but rarely are they used as effectively as seen here. In many cases, such elaborate CGI effects are permitted to overwhelm the content and presentation of the story. The showrunners have achieved a balance that eludes most filmmakers involved in blockbuster films with astronomical budgets fail to achieve this degree of seamless integration. What is so impressive here is that even with the effects included such elaborate constructs as a giant dragon flying over a crowded battlefield immolating the enemy in droves. Still, despite the magnificent experience this scene created, what remained of paramount importance is how it forwarded the story arch and developing the various characters, ringing the winged reptile into battle is Daenerys Targaryen (Emilia Clarke), Storm born, Mother of Dragons and breaker of chains. Her character ache is among the most dramatic, in the series. Initially, Daenerys was a teenage girl dependent upon others for everything; her brother controls her to such a degree he sold her into marriage to a savage warlord. Through the course of the story, she gained confidence allowing her to conquer kingdoms, overthrow a slave-based economy and develop unprecedented as a tactician, strategist, and diplomate. A reserved young girl has become the most powerful, and dangerous woman in the world. Commanding the only three dragons left in the world provides unmatched air support for the overwhelming forces at her command. She has the loyalty of the Unsullied, the most disciplined army in the world. Sworn to her are the Dothraki, fierce, barbaric and the best equine force on two continents. Finally, she has a fleet of thousands of ships giving her superiority on land, sea, and air. The only enemy remaining capable of any threat is Cersei Lannister (Lena Headey). She is the most cunning, ruthless and driven person in the seven kingdoms. To rid herself of any potential threats from her many enemies she used a reserve of wildfire, a type of napalm of Greek fire to burn them all to death during what was supposed to be an assembly adjourned to judge her on several capital crimes. The devastation took a large swath of innocent lives collateral damage. As these two extremely powerful women are inexorably drawn inexorably into a final conflict, there is a potentially apocalyptic danger north of the Great Ice Wall, the Night King and his undead zombie army of White Walkers. A bastard from the Great House of Stark, Jon Snow (Kit Harington), newly hailed as the King of the North. Rather than opposing the Lannister rule on the Iron Throne, Johs main ally is the eldest daughter of the house of Stark, Sansa (Sophie Turner). She has come along way from a privileged young lady, harden in a crucible of forced relationships with a psychological monster to a psychopath who raped and sodomized her on her wedding night. Sansa has developed a hard façade and a calculating mind suitable During this season Sansa is reunited with her younger sister, Arya (Maisie Williams). She has mastered the mastered the art of assassination and disguise, that latter is expressed with such expertise, that she can wear the face of another person. Together with her older sister to extract the long overdue just revenge on a man who has brutally betrayed family. Their youngest brother, Bran (Isaac Hempstead Wright). He has taken up the mystical mantle of the Three Eye Raven, imbued with a sight that transcends time and space. While the now adult Stark children have once again united their mortal enemies, the three remaining Lannisters are divided. Cersei is certifiable bat guano crazy. Now that she sits on the Iron Throne she rules through fear and intimidation. Ever her fraternal twin brother/lover/father of her children, Jaime (Nikolaj Coster-Waldau), realizes she must be stopped. Their youngest brother, Tyrion (Peter Dinklage), is a dwarf banished after killing their father. Overlooked due to his short stature he is one of the most intelligent men in the kingdoms he has aligned with Daenerys along with spymaster, Lord Varys (Conleth Hill), she not only has a massive military force but the advisors capable of maximizing their might. The ensemble cast is huge and rarely shown together. Circumstances are such that they are brought together not just in combat but in response to Jon Snows dire warning about the world ending the threat of the White Walkers. There is no shortage of threats, unusual alliances so that the final episodes of the highly anticipated final episodes are not likely to disappoint the devoted fan base. bullet From Imagination to Reality: Inside the Art Department bullet Extensive two-part featurette detailing the astonishing work of Production Designer Deborah Riley and her Art Department, dissecting the process behind the creation of this season s incredible new sets, including Dragonstone, Casterly Rock, Highgarden, the Dragonpit, and more. bullet Fire & Steel: Creating the Invasion of Westeros bullet Revisit this season s most pivotal moments with this behind-the-scenes featurette, including interviews with key cast and crew breaking down how fans favorite moments were created. bullet Plus 11 Audio Commentaries with the cast and crew, including David Benioff, D.B.

7,5.0,"Game of Thrones' disparate plot threads coalesce in the show's best season overall, thanks to high stakes tension and meticulous power plays that result in constant thrills and long term payoffs for all of its lovable characters."
7,4.5,Just the fact the producers decided to make us fans wait so long between seasons to end the show is why I didnt give 5 stars for this season. This show excellent from the very first episode until the last. I have no doubt the final episodes will be excellent!
7,4.0,"Solid though slightly disappointing season that delivers a lot of great moments but fills more like a setup for the final season. The acting is superb across the board, and is great to see new characters finally meet each while others reunite. Behind the camera, the show runners deliver plenty of action and drama, (as usual, the second to last episode is the best) while also bringing some stories to a close (some surprising death, especially from those that have been around since the beginning). However, for the most part, it fills like putting the pieces in place for the final season, making it only slightly better than season 5. Granted, a bad season of ""Game of Thrones"" is still better than most TV you'll ever get, and that cliffhanger ending will have you clamoring for the final run."
7,4.0,This season was way faster than the other seasons. The temp and speed increased way too much and sadly we could not see any major character die. Sorry cannot rate it as a critic. Big Fan.
7,5.0,"The long investment in the best example of character development of any television series of all time, pays off in season 7 in epic fashion."
7,5.0,It just improves and improves after season. One word: Amazing.
7,5.0,As close to can't miss TV as you can get.
7,1.0,"STUPID, BORING, ILLOGICAL, NONSENSICAL, DUMB, MIND NUMBING AND LITERALLY FOR FRUITCAKES"
7,5.0,"To short, but still The best TV series of all time."
7,4.0,The best season!! Ending f*** u up
7,4.0,i love that dragon and sexy queen of dragon
7,4.0,"They are going more predictable. But direction, acting, cast, costumes, CGI, VFX everything sums up to get the 4-4.5 Stars"
7,0.5,For the one eye sign in the picture too illuminati
7,5.0,"Great acting from the cast, stunning effects and CGI, some humor, the story moves forward in a great way... It has everything! Action, tension, romance, twists, and, of course... DRAGONS!"
7,5.0,"Very different from the way George wrote GOT, but they brought the action, and this season was incredible."
7,3.0,"This was the least developed season so far. Time elapses at a jarring pace that sometimes events seemed rushed and people are always saved in the nick of time. This is a short season and there could have been some more expansion of some of these characters, such as Jorah, Grey Worm, Ser Davos, etc. There was a lot of action and left on quite the cliffhanger, but this season could have been executed more soundly."
7,0.5,The writers and producers are starting to lose sight of what made this show great. The writing is getting lazy and boring.
7,4.0,"GOT is always must-see TV for me. Had some difficulties with the timelines this season, but still very much enjoyed the ride. Exciting. Complex characters. Great acting. I keep hoping the White Walker menace will get more depth: the White Walkers need to be elevated to something more than pure boogeyman at some point. The series has explored the gray-areas of every major character except the Night King."
7,4.0,It's not a surprise anymore. Game of thrones is a show that you simply can't miss.
7,2.0,"Great effects but the many departures from the basics have sapped the credibility from the characters and storyline. Characters act contrary to their established nature to create conflict (the Winterfell storyline). Armies storm castles instantly without a siege (Highgarden). Characters can swim underwater in full armour (Jamie). And of course John's night on the rocky island in the north that somehow lasts for 2 weeks for all other characters. In the end, it has slipped from great fantasy to all out preposterous."
7,4.0,"Amazing costimes, music and CGI but the story has gone a little downhill. Still a 4/5 though."
7,5.0,I can't wait for season 8. Jon Snow/ Aegon Targaryen FTW.
7,0.5,Writing and plausibility and immersion out the window. This is fan fiction now.
7,0.5,"Worse season yet! I just do not understand how anyone would like this season of game of thrones. My reasons were perfectly summed up by the Video ""Game of Thrones; Or The Pain Of Falling Out Of Love With A Story"" by the YouTube-Cannel ""Just Write""."
7,2.0,"Despite its trademark brilliant directing, acting, special effects and music, this season of Game of Thrones has seen it sink into the fantasy clichè of good triumphing over evil, stupidly rapid pacing and a complete lack of consequences. Game of Thrones razor sharp storytelling has blunted from a samurai sword to a letter opener."
7,4.0,"Puntaje Original: 8.4 Gloriosa y épica, con increíbles efectos visuales, diseño de producción, aparte de la siempre impactante trama de esta serie."
7,4.5,Amazin season with what must be on of the best clif hanngers yet.
7,4.5,great season put episode 706 was a little to fast paced
7,3.0,"Poorly written and idiotically paced moments overshadow the talent behind the acting and visuals of the hit drama; however, the seventh season of 'Thrones' is still massively entertaining and enjoyable (although slightly more predictable)."
7,4.0,"Still one of the best shows but it has lost a lot in this season. Everyone meeting, a lot of characters don't get enough time on the screen and fast travel has ruined a lot. Not different anymore like it used to be..."
7,4.0,"Hated how short this season was, so much could've been done instead of rushing us through some of the story lines unlike the first three seasons. The Spoils of War was my episode this season, wonderfully orchestrated from beginning to end."
7,0.5,it was awful. horrible season the worst so far you guys are total sell outs.
7,4.0,"rich world, characters to invest, off pacing and writing at times"
7,5.0,"Grandes efectos, grandes momentos y al fin llegó el invierno. La serie formó a cada personaje de manera excelente para llegar a éste momento. Todo está listo, y esta temporada es el gran puente hacia el esperado final. ¿Quién ganará el juego de tronos? Me lo pregunto cada día. Gran serie, gran temporada, y el invierno está aquí."
7,5.0,This was my favirote season yet
7,5.0,"Game of Thrones: Season 7 Filled with everything fans wanted most yet left them yearning for more, Game of Thrones: Season 7 up the games a level and set a pretty high bar for tv series quality."
7,5.0,Wondered what the hype was. Signed up for HBO and started watching GOT from season 1 and I absolutely loved it.
7,5.0,"Seemed rushed a bit but still spectacular script, graphics"
7,4.0,"An improvement over Season 6 but still rather scattershot and the teleporting of characters gets from amusing to absurd. Like the 6th season though this year gets its strength from a couple strong episodes rather than the narrative as a whole which hasn't been that strong since Season 4 and the show started to go beyond the books. Rushing hurts the story after all but what we do get is strong enough to still be a solid outing, I just wish Dan and Dave had the time and budget for this to still be 10 episodes, maybe with the extra time the storyline would have been smoother and I could have ranked this among the great seasons back in 1-4. Can't wait for finale though, shame the wait will be so long..."
7,5.0,This might actually be the best season of the show.
7,5.0,Wow. Most amazing TV show ever!!
7,3.0,"Disappointed. This is my least favourite, could have been better."
7,4.0,"Still good, but getting a little predictable."
7,5.0,To fast but still amazing.
7,5.0,One of the best tv-shows ever...
7,3.0,not as good as the others
7,5.0,"The greatest epic in television history. I'm never seen performances so grounded with such a rapid pace of character maturity so well done. Sonically & aesthetically second to none, and subtle toning with the personalize theming is marvelous."
7,4.5,"And now, the latest season, season 7. This season was definitely epic, gore and amazing! The problem here ain't boredom, it's some missing elements! The sexual content is totally lost, the violence is down and the battle in episode 6 wasn't so epic, but it was good though! But it has a very stupid thing, how the White Walkers brought the dragon?! So because of the missing elements, season 7 went down!"
7,4.5,"One of the highest budget TV shows out there, season 7 contains some of the most athletically pleasing TV show action scenes to date, however, the show feels somewhat rushed, and surprises and deaths come and go without the same weight they used to have, Still it was probably the most exciting piece of Television for the year."
7,5.0,Best season of GoT. By far.
7,5.0,"no doubt there is nudity (mostly unnecessary and in the earlier seasons) and graphic violence (that can catch you unawares). but, if you can get past that, there are compelling reasons worth considering of why this is the most highly rated tv show of all time: 1. it is unparalleled in its epic and masterful storytelling able to get you to care about a massive amount of characters on an even wider spectrum of types in all types of situations in all shades of their being 2. then it is not afraid to kill off these very principle characters all throughout, but most of all 3. it demonstrates a deep understanding of human nature that people are rarely as simple as we'd like them to be."
7,5.0,This my favorite show.. i feel ever in life!...There has never been a better one...ever in life!! one more season and i will miss it...I love you GOT!!
7,5.0,"A Review of Thrones With the seventh season of the phenomenon at a close, it is still accurate to say that the little screen adaptation of George R.R. Martins fantasy epic is one of the greatest television shows of all time. HBOs behemoth of a show began in 2011, and has since then risen to become an icon of popular culture. To date, Game of Thrones has been nominated for 612 awards and has received 212 of them; the show holds the title for the most Emmys for a primetime television show at 38, and it is conceivable that the two seasons of the show yet to be scored will overtake Saturday Night Lives 45 wins to becomeaccording to that standardthe most accomplished show in television history. The story of Game of Thrones is not one that can be constricted down into a few-sentence recapitulation, for the complexity and intricacy of its numerous plots and subplots would not be given its due. From the first episode to the most recent season finale, plot threads have woven characters connections and personal arcs to each others in nearly unfathomable ways, sparking and furthering the growth that every character has undergone that exemplifies the richness of this world. The show transports its audience to a world in which mystical fantasy, medieval brutality, and timeless politics merge seamlessly into a brilliantly written story; mirroring the blights on our own world, the characters that have captivated the audience with their quirky wit or vicious savagery and imbued them with passions of hate and love must face an unforgiving society that cares not for justice and fairness. This show will capture the intrigue of its viewers while it sends on an emotional journey to euphoria or heartache or both many times over. It will incite laughter, evoke tears, inspire shock, and demand cheers of triumph or curses of anger, but most of all Game of Thrones will bestow upon its audiencenotoriously without remorse and with great frequencysenses of utter awe. Whether they be crushingly heart-wrenching character deaths or unexpected plot-twists or realistic depictions of violence or incredibly intelligent dialogue or breathtakingly immaculate scenery or powerful character moments, this show will consume the mind with its genius and leave the viewer breathless. The acclaim for television show is entirely warranted. The acting for the show is at a standard worthy for the spectacle, and it is no wonder that the actors and actresses who appear on the show are instantly perceived as skilled practitioners of their craft. Notable actors who propel the work to its highly-lauded status are those who play Ned Stark (Sean Bean), Tyrion Lannister (Peter Dinklage), Cersei Lannister (Lena Headey), Jaime Lannister (Nikolaj Caster-Waldau), Catelyn Stark (Michelle Fairley), Olenna Tyrell (Dianna Rigg), and Tywin Lannister (Charles Dance). The show is an ensemble cast, but each of its actors excels in making each scene palpably important in relation to the characters presented. Furthermore, the other technical aspects of the show are impeccable. HBO has endowed the show with an increasingly large budget, which has furthered the quality of large-scale battles and the rendering of the dragons. Ever since season one, however, all of the aspects that make the show a technical marvelthe thorough costume design, adept make-up and lighting, discernably superior sound design, beautifully potent music and scoreswere present. David Benioff and D.B. Weiss, the showrunners of Game of Thrones, have distinguished their show into a class of its own. It is not a far cry from the truth to say that Game of Thrones is the greatest television show that has thus far been created. Not faultlessthe recently concluded penultimate season was a mixture of Game of Thrones at its best and its worstbut as much a masterpiece as a show can get. It is hard to find an entertainment-inclined person unfamiliar with certain quotes and aspects that come from the world of Westeros and Essos, and it seems unlikely that the shows endgamewhich will be revealed in the six episodes of the eighth and final seasonwill not become another facet of popular culture. Understanding that fact, do not let the end to what truly might be the greatest show ever be spoiled for you before you endeavor to indulge in this fantasy world. Before it is all over and you cannot unknow that which you learned, experience the phenomenon. Follow the honorable Ned Stark and the triumphs and misfortunes of his Northern House. Cheer for Jon Snow, the bastard of Winterfell, as he finds that qualities of an honorable leader are direly needed. Laugh with Tyrion Lannister, the drunken dwarf, as he discovers what the game is and why it must be won. Witness the transformation of Daenerys Targaryen from a helpless princess to the Queen Mother of Dragons. Their stories have not yet ended, but come the final season all their fates will be sealed and known. The threat of the White Walkers is still dominant, the mysteries of Jon and Dany still present. If you watch the show years from now, you will be but an observer of the world of Game of Thrones, but if you watch now, you will be a part of A Song of Ice and Fire. Winter is here, but it wont last forever. Rating: 5 Comings of Winter out of 5"
7,5.0,I love this show and can't get enough of it! One of the best shows on TV todayl
7,5.0,"no need for review,the whole world knows its supremacy and legacy. Proud to be a GOT fan!!"
7,1.0,Season 7 was bad.It lacks the deapth of storytelling and character development of last seasons.And fancy efects can'? change that
7,2.5,"Game of Thrones has really, really lost something since it strayed from the books. In terms of narrative, and character development. I find characters behaving in completely unexpected ways, and I'm not sure if it's a good thing. The plot armour they all wear is wearing thin. The plot itself is struggling; apparently, the characters have time machines to travel in - and the plot holes are getting harder and harder to ignore for the sake of cool battle scenes."
7,5.0,"Simply put: The best TV show in the history of shows and TV. This season was sadly rushed but I still enjoyed every minute of it, as by this point we can easily imagine what was happening as everyone time warped around Westeros."
7,5.0,Best series of all time.
7,5.0,Probably the best TV-Show ever
7,3.0,Getting worse as it nears The End. Worth for the long awaited events and moments though.
7,2.5,"mediocre writing. Obviously geared to making sure the 'good' guys/gals win most of the time. More like a superhero flick than good story telling. There is lack of any edge to the show now that JRR Martin isn't overseeing the plot. The White Walkers have become even more one dimensional baddies. Characters seem to be able to beam around the westros continent with no regard for time or distance. Entire conflicts are resolved in episodes that seem rushed and less nuanced than what one would expect from the previous 6 seasons. Basically its gotten way too predictable. The good : Kept up High production values, ended trivial or non-essential plot lines and redundant characters."
7,5.0,"5 stars, and not just to fit in with the popular opinion."
7,4.0,"Doesn't hit on all cylinders like Season 6 did, and is probably the most cartoonish run to date, but still the most exciting thing going on on TV at the moment."
7,1.0,GoT goes into a full tailspin
7,4.5,"This season did a phenomenal job in that all the episodes were packed with good content (Which could be because of the fewer episodes). This season started with a bang picking up after the incineration we saw last season, and ended with a longing wait for the next season."
7,5.0,This season definitely had a much bigger budget than other past seasons.
7,5.0,The best tv show ever!!!
7,2.5,"Expected more from GOT, plot is getting way too un-believeable and contrived. Not the same quality as the previous seasons (previous seasons: 5/5 stars)"
7,5.0,Great show. Need more episodes. Will miss this show when it's gone.
7,1.5,I rly don't know why i still watch this show
7,3.5,"It is a good thing that Game of Thrones is nearing its conclusion, for I do not think the show could maintain its current standard for longer than another season - and that's being generous, since the quality seems to have been on the decline for a while now. The latest season has some of the best visuals of the series, but its overabundance can mitigate the impact that each scene is supposed to carry. It was never going to be easy, ensuring that the show was consistently great up until the very end. But here's to hoping that it will keep entertaining and amazing its viewership while staying true to itself and making the best possible ending instead of catering to its audience."
7,4.5,"Cada vez vemos mas cerca el inminente ataque de los caminantes blancos, una temporada muy apresurada pero con grandes momentos y batallas."
7,5.0,"Best serie ever, looking foward to season 8!"
7,3.5,"Game of Thrones is more than ever stuck in a stale screenplay. The plot has lost its original complexity as well as the characters have lost their moral ambiguity and credibility. The show has no courage left. The story is mostly predictable and prefers to play safe even if it means to be implausible and lazy (the worst examples are all in episode 6). Esthetically is still a wonder, for eyes and ears, with good action sequences. Game of Thrones, however, is now stripped of its soul that once made it a novelty for the audience."
7,1.5,"With few exceptions, the writing, the plot, and the characters were 'weird' in a not-good way. A lot of scenes and character actions simply didn't make sense (for example, Tyrion suddenly becoming stupid and short-sighted despite being portrayed as the opposite of that in Seasons 1 and 2). Perhaps the most... idiotic plotline is the whole catch-the-wight farce along with the gold-medal winning, javelin-throwing night king not to mention the suddenly invincible characters (Jaime, Jon, Tormund, etc.). All in all, I hated this season as it didn't make sense to me at all. However, the visuals, special effects, and costumes were unbelievable."
7,4.0,"Game of Thrones: Season 7 is created by David Benioff and D. B. Weiss, and it stars Kit Harington, Emilia Clarke, Lena Headey, Sophie Turner, Maisie Williams, Nikolaj Coster-Waldau, and Peter Dinklage in a medieval fantasy about a war going on from the North, King's Landing, and Dragonstone, but the North knows that there's a bigger army out there that is going to destroy all of them, and so they are trying to convince the others to work together against the White Walkers. I start with this as my first season to review because my mind is still fresh on the season, and I been wanting to review this show for a long time as this is my favorite show to watch. When I get enough time to do all that, I'll review the previous seasons for this show, and for this, I can say that while it's not the best season of the show, I was still enjoying it for what it is, and how they have to continue the show when they can't wait for George R. R. Martin's next book. The acting is always in their A game, and with Lena Headey's character having to be the ruler of King's Landing, I've never seen her act so much of a bitch than I did with her in the previous seasons where she was still a jerk, but not to an extent here, which is always enjoyable to watch. Arya Stark is my favorite character in the show, and there are some moments that were very satisfying for her character. Even though it was 7 episodes long, I didn't feel like it was rushed, nor boring to watch, and there were way more action scenes than in any seasons of this show, which is a lot of fun and is well done. The effects look amazing, especially the dragons as they are the best looking dragons that I've seen in any movie or show. When this season is basically building up to the final season, there's always something going on in this season that doesn't make it feel like filler. There are some issues that I have with the season however, and it's that there are some plot moments that felt predictable or that some of the character logic that didn't make sense. While the writing is solid enough, there are some aspects that were not quite strong. Game of Thrones: Season 7 is a great season that with the next season being the last one, I can't wait to see how they end it."
7,2.0,Season 7 jumped to shark. Only watched the finale to say I finished the season. Don't care anymore.
7,4.0,"I'll say is that I'm quite satisfied with season 7 as a whole. The show has actually grown bolder without its ""book safety-net"" and this season was a better one than the sixth without a net at all (even though I believe George RR Martin helped fill in the blanks here and there). I also believe this is the part two of a trilogy in the series (season 6 part one and obviously season 8 part 3), which means that many things that might have feelt left out and without explanation will get resolved in the last part."
7,5.0,"Season 7 - Game of Thrones had such a great season even though it was shorter than I would have liked. The story was tight and interesting the whole season long! The dragon effects (as well as the rest of the effects) were amazing. I loved the previous seasons, but this season was the best so far!"
7,0.5,"GOT is a piece of shit, fuck u fanboys"
7,3.0,"A lot happened this season in a short amount of time which is both it's strength and weakness. There were a lot of fantastic action scenes featuring the dragons that we've all been waiting for, some dramatic deaths and some interesting character developments. However, you really feel the decrease in episodes because events are seriously sped up, characters teleport from place to place, plans and plots are played out within seconds of their making and we lose a lot of the excellent dialogue heavy scenes that made the early seasons so good. The writing also seemed to suffer a little this season, whether that's because they no longer have the reins of the books to hold on to or because they're pressed for time is unclear, characters make very on the nose statements and do too much foreshadowing of events further on in the season which can be a little frustrating and feel more like a fanfiction than the product itself. Overall though, it was an enjoyable season but after season 6 was so strong and we suffered some serious losses of beloved characters, this season falls a little short."
7,4.5,Once again the series does not disappoint with another spectacular series
7,3.0,"Some great action scenes, but a lot of stuff was boring talking and wooden acting!"
7,5.0,Every episode this season felt like a film. I was blown away.
7,3.5,"Ok. We had a lot of great moments, that we sure missed in some previously seasons. But I sure miss the great plots and the courage and spirit of GoT to kill those characters that even though we love, need to go to make the story even better. All in all, it was a great season, not the best, but yes, a great season."
7,5.0,the best season ever!!!!
7,3.5,"entertaining, well-written, and well-acted."
7,5.0,the best tv-serie of all times
7,5.0,I really love it!!! Go go Dany shut down the Night King!!
7,3.0,"the intricate storytelling of previous seasons was sacrificed in favour of contrived plots aimed at getting the large cast on-screen together. The set-pieces were still enjoyable, but it's very clear the Thrones i now siffering uder the weight of its enormous world-building and global expectation."
7,4.5,One of my favorites of all time.
7,4.5,Good season ????????????
7,3.5,really bad last season
7,3.0,Not this season with only 7 episodes. They pushed too fast.
7,4.0,"George R. R. Martin has a three step formula which is basically as follows: 1. Flagrantly plagiarize a much better author (Frank Herbert) 2. Throw in lots of meaningless sex 3. Use shock-killing of prominent characters as a gimmick Dude's a sh!tty author who's best ideas where ripped off and who's own ideas are lowbrow pulp. However, this isn't his book series. This is the television adaptation. A television adaptation which (not surprisingly) got noticeably better the moment the source material ran out. Season 6 and season 7 are easily the best so far. It isn't just a glorified soap-opera anymore. Things move quicker, the good guys occasionally win, there is actual romance instead of just sleaze and rape. Perhaps most importantly things that the audience wants to happen actually do... like all the way to completion, not just 99% of the way only to have the carpet pulled out from underneath when some horrible thing happens in another of Martin's cynical and bitter deconstructions of what he feels are tired literary tropes. Granted the show is also helped (a great deal) by an amazing cast and a budget that at least appears to get bigger each season. The costumes and CGI for instance are noticeably better now and there are proper scenes of large pitched battle that seem more befitting a conflict on the scale described in the show's dialog. Season 7 is my favorite season so far because it serves the purpose of entertaining and intriguing the audience in a way that pretentious deconstruction never can. I'm finally enjoying rooting from some of these characters without worrying that they'll do something stupid and get off'd 10 seconds later. If like me you were only continuing to watch GoT to see it through but noticed a change in pace last season, you should definitely stick around for season 7 since it accelerates forward in a similar fashion as season 6."
7,0.5,"More and more Game of Thrones is looking like Disney or Hollywood films, rather than what it first made it amazing to watch: Knowing there was no right or wrong, or that what fans wanted wasn't going to be what was going to happen. Now we have so many moments that seemed to be so fan service more than anything else. Empty plots, or reasons, more in favour of visuals and of wooing the audience with those visuals or forced scenes (like Arya's and Sansa's tense moments... Just there for the audience) instead of development or a look into how in the world there truly isn't a black or white or a happily ever after..."
7,5.0,"Just as the Sopranos changed TV in the early 2000's, Game of Thrones has changed it once again in the 2010's. While the Sopranos introduced long form writing, the whole idea of a massive story arc bolstered by season story arcs and lastly by episode arcs, GOT explodes these ideas with a huge character list, a gender challenging agenda, and an unpredictable story that throws everyone down the tubes if thats what it takes. Season Seven is both phenomenal and slightly disappointing. Now that the end is neigh, story lines are closing left and right. Most are satisfying, some less so. The collisions between the rivals, the magical set pieces, the pointed dialogue - all have the sense of an ending. The final twist, the felling of the great wall by a zombie dragon was simply breathtaking. I have never seen a show where the words fuck and cunt are so frequently used no one seems to notice. That the women characters can be both heroic and or psychopathic is astonishing. Of course, only the men die in battle - nothing new there. But to see the fantasy of having the wicked Queen, the Dragon Queen, the Lady of the North - wield so much power is refreshing and, of course, fantastical. The idea of Brianne besting the Hound was pretty ridiculous, but it seems even more wicked curves will be thrown before the last of this amazing series. Benioff and Weiss are geniuses. I am hoping the WW and the zombies win, but I fear I may be disappointed. TV on a scale we never saw before."
7,5.0,??????? ??????? ?????? ???...???????? ???-???? ????????? ??????? ?? ??????? ??? :3 ??? ?????? ???? ????? <3
7,4.0,Well the winter was here for 7 weeks and now its gone again!
7,4.5,"What makes this season so great, is that we have spent the last 6 seasons getting to know the characters and they are all now coming together. The pace and tone of some episodes has been a bit different."
7,4.0,"I can't understand why so much hate towards this season. Ok, it's not as good as the other seasons, but they had very limited time to do anything. Also, many complain about the plotholes. First of all, all the movies and all the series have plotholes, espesially the ones with the characters, the world and the story of Game of Thrones. Secondly, many of the ""plotholes"" can be explained, like the killing of Viserion and not Drogon, or the knoghts of the Veil betraying Littlefinger. It's just a marvellous series that many people, like me, are proud to be fans of to this day and many try to play it ""cool"" and ""alternative"" just because it is a popular show, or because they just want to see the first four to five seasons, just because they had R.R. Martin"
7,0.5,"A garbage season for a once great show. No real plot whatsoever, just huge plot holes and fight scenes. Please hire real writers for the final season."
7,4.5,"Great, quick season, but the second to last episode is a casualty of the faster pace; it was lazy and nonsensical- but still damn entertaining."
7,5.0,i f*cking love this series. no understatement
7,5.0,"The only show that makes me ache for and incest so badly and get some characters to die in horrible ways, and also that have my mom approve and love"
7,4.5,"Game of Thrones Season 7 may only have 7 episodes, but what it lacks in its usual amount of episodes it surely makes up in exciting, heart-drenching sequences and surprising revelations. Arguments can be may on the 'style over substance' sacrifice this season has made but there's no denying the sheer dramatic tour de force it brought making the series bigger and better today. 4.5/5"
7,5.0,Sensacional do início ao fim.
7,0.5,I just don't like it.
7,5.0,smh omg wow (2 viewings)
7,5.0,"Season 7 is not better than seasons 3 and 4 but is definitely better that season 1,2,5,6. HBO again showed all their muscles not only in writing great scripts but also in filming very interesting and epic scenes. The events are now happeing much faster than before and that's why we get only information that is needed for the plot without useless ""water"". 5/5"
7,4.0,"Following up on the series' most crowd-pleasing season, Game of Thrones penultimate year once again goes by the strategy of giving the audience what they want. Thing is it's not quite as successful this year as last, as the truly gratifying moments don't really come to season end, and the writers don't seem to be willing to get as dark as George R.R. Martin's books do (I'll admit I'm a sucker for major character deaths). Still, when this season is at its best it rivals the series' best scenes, and it comes with a finale that's as meme-ready as anything else this year. Showrunners David Benioff and D. B. Weiss have often called Game of Thrones ""The Sopranos in Middle Earth"", and if that's the case then let's hope that it imitates that series by giving us a sub-par season right before an outstanding finale!"
7,4.0,"Puntaje Original: 8.4 Gloriosa y épica, con increíbles efectos visuales, diseño de producción, aparte de la siempre impactante trama de esta serie."
7,5.0,"The best season yet and that is BOLD statement. I just don't understand why they are ending this series. I know the books and everything but the writers could of altered the story or whatever. Anyway I hope they do a prequel series, perhaps the rise and fall of the Mad King leading up to season 1."
7,4.5,"Game of Thrones continues its masterful storytelling to follow up the great sixth season, providing great dialogues and bringing together its great characters for scenes that are filled with great tension and an awesome amount of dragon action, despite its unusually extreme pacing that takes time to adjust to."
7,5.0,"If I could give this season more than 6 stars, I would. The storyline, acting CG, music all come together to make something that is unbelivably breathtaking."
7,2.0,"Badly written, inconsistent. They'd better have waited for GRRM upcoming book."
7,5.0,There are still so many possible outcomes. I hope some serious strategizing for the endgame takes place and can't wait to witness it.
7,5.0,"There is not a better show ever created in my opinion. Character development, storyline, cinematography, acting all are superb. Very realistic, so for some the violence may be too much, but keep watching you'll be hooked."
7,4.5,"This season is fantastic but in episode 6, I don't know how are they find that big chains?"
7,2.0,"This has been the least enjoyable season of Game of Thrones thus far. For some reason (budgets perhaps?) producers decided to condense the narrative of this season. Gone is the immaculate attention to detail which Game of Thrones fans has grown used to. Instead we are rushed from one scene to another without any intrigue or intensity. As someone who has read all the books in the Songs of Ice and Fire series, I find this particular season to be very disappointing. Perhaps if GRRM had completed the series of books, the producers would have created a better season. But without GRRM's books to draw from, it seems they've run out of creative ideas"
7,5.0,"Doesn't get any better than this !!!, Great TV show"
7,3.0,"For a show that has spent so long cultivating a universe and characters that are so believable this season feels rushed. It seems they are forcing the story to a quick conclusion now. Season 6 was brilliant, this season has been a let down. Still good action and a few good scenes though. I just want book 6 to come out."
7,4.0,"GOT season 7 is a total fan service, loving it so far."
7,1.5,Big pile of expensive sh*t
7,5.0,All things considered Season 7 has been as good as if not better than any previous season - with certainly more momentum. As of now GOT is potentially the greatest TV show ever made and certainly the standard by which all similar fantasies of the genre will be measured
7,5.0,Awsome series and waiting for battles now :-)
7,5.0,Again this show delivers - excellent acting all around and plot moves- action packed scenes and snappy interactions between characters
7,5.0,"This season blew me away, it's visually outstanding, and continues it's beautiful, character driven story and subplots."
7,2.0,"I thought that with the cut of episodes, the quality would improve, leaving aside the plot fill and the senseless scenes, but I was wrong. We had a solid beginning until chapter 4. A well-balanced narrative with interesting events, but afterwards, everything goes out of the hands of the showmakers. The narrative becomes hasty and meaningless, everything seems hurried and the dialogues and performances reach their maximum cartonization. All of this, of course, offset by good special effects and cliffhangers that will make fans keep saying it's ""the best series ever."" D & D demonstrate once again their inability to handle a story or characters. Bad narrative, bad performances, waste of characters and innumerable plot holes. Game of Thrones has become an equivalent of WWE. We are attracted to the show and nothing more. People continue to see it for it. It excites us and keeps us entertained that we do not pay attention to the absurdity of dialogues and plot, which have reached an unimaginable level. That's Season 7 of Game of Thrones."
7,5.0,"My favorite show. Ever. I'm a nerdling who is obsessed with the books, and the show brings to life the characters I used to only imagine in my head perfectly and accurately."
7,0.5,Overrated by everyone. Uses nudity and dragons to maintain an audience.
7,5.0,valar morghulis bitches!
7,5.0,WTF can it be said puking amazing
7,5.0,A melhor série que eu já vi e continua se mantendo assim
7,5.0,the greatest season ever
7,5.0,great tv series and amazing series I ever seen or watched my entire life
7,5.0,"Either you enjoy this show, or let it infuriate you. Almost immediately you will decide who you love and who you despise, who you'll support and who you're against. But that's what makes this show stand out, it's the unpredictability and everyone has a different stance on who's the best (for me it's Daenerys!) but I've got to warn you, if you can't handle characters dying in almost every episode, then this is not for you!"
7,5.0,Why are you reading reviews of this show stop what you're doing and GO WATCH THIS RIGHT NOW - NOW!
7,5.0,The best season to date. All the pieces of this slick puzzle are coming together and it's simply awesome.
7,5.0,The Best Ever Show that TV showed human.
7,4.5,"Possibly the show with the best written characters of all time. 4.5, really good!"
7,4.5,"Short a few lulls, which are few and far between, this has been a perfect action packed season for GoT. This could turn out to be the best so far as the story lines start to collide and tie together finally."
7,5.0,?????????very very hot !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
7,1.5,"NOT the best show out there. Relies too heavily on the shock value of its horribly brutal deaths and obscenely violent scenes. This show provides no true or thematic weight necessary to deliver moral values to the general audience. Gives unrealistic expectations for women, the so called ""roll models"" having shapely, near perfect bodies in comparison to your average THOT."
7,4.5,I rarely stop caring about anything rather than what happens inside the story of a film/series and this one does exactly that. What is cinema trying to achieve if not getting us to care about things that aren't real.
7,5.0,Couldn't be any better
7,5.0,What a powerful episode to see the dragon kill the lanester is jaw dropping... Wow can't wait for the next episode...
7,2.5,"The show once was thrilling now has the bad sides of the adaptions we hate. Stupid storyline mistakes, underdevelop characters, cheezy reactions, Emilie Clarke's bad acting, huge distinctions between the book... It's not the same show in season 1,2,3.."

7,5.0,Excellent...enough said
7,0.5,"Oy! It bores me to death! I am a big LOTR fan and a friend suggested I would LOVE this. No. Soap opera quality nonsense. I've tried watching it three different times but NO DEAL. Not for me at all, even tried to read the first book and even that didn't help."
7,5.0,This season is intense and amazing!
7,4.5,Great stuff ... story moving right along
7,2.0,"Definitely not as good as previous episodes. If I had to choose one word to sum up this episode, it would be - melodramatic."
7,5.0,"Without a doubt one of the most fascinating storylines on TV. This series does the books justice. The characters are well thought out, great acting, and it's definitely a show that you can not wait for the next weeks episode."
7,5.0,Duh! Just watch from season 1 and keep going till your eyes bleed and the watch it again! Golden age of TV. No doubt! Give it 3 or five episodes to hook you if need be. Season 7 is a metaphor for our current state of fairs in the world today - btw!! Love Emilia!

7,5.0,"Game of Thrones is the ONLY movie/ tv show that I will EVER rate 5/5. The acting, the scenery, the action sequences, EVERYthing, about this show is perfectly made. Game of Thrones will go down in history as one of the greatest cinematic successes of our time. I didn't even need to make this review, you guys already know this."
7,5.0,"Well, we had ultradorf ... and he's the shyte ... then we have the queen of dragons and she's how to say ... like dragonfire right ... and NOW we have both of them on one side ... thats like HOT shit in the face of the undead king ? im kinda hoping its the final season though or this might end in spinouts ... momentum ... how preposterous to complain being the most wanted series since breaking bad ? the point eludes me. Being a fan of greatness but never having been a groupie of anything though its probably hard for the moneygrubbing filth on top i still hope this is the last season and the night king will be a finale to leave everyone with mouth open for the last 30 minutes. Because i dont think it can go up from here, a pitfall that seems hard to avoid ... because of the moneygrubbing filth on top :)"
7,5.0,Just Love Game of Thrones!
7,5.0,As always a story line that will continue to keep you thrilled to the last minute All the characters that have survived to the 7th season deserve our attention simple because they have adapted and survived
7,4.5,"Overall, the season seven premiere was powerful and focused. While nothing monumental happened, it was pivotal that the second-to-last season of the fantastic show hit the ground running. Dragonstone was the epic start to the end of Game of Thrones."
7,5.0,The season premiere is everything you want and expect from Game of Thrones. 5/5!
7,5.0,Season 7 is one of there best seasons.
7,5.0,"Wow. I loved this! Can't wait for what's next! ""Shall we begin?"""
7,5.0,Looks like Game of Thrones will forever be perfect.
7,5.0,Probably the best season of the show! Breathtaking!
7,3.0,"Only reason I'm watching it anymore is because I've already watched so much of it. What began as an intricate web of politics has now been reduced to overly hyped pointless bloodshed and ice fairies and dragons knitted with characters (which aren't killed because they're fan favorites) and stretched mindless plot that facilitates their redundancy,"
7,5.0,year after year...this is still top of the tops... what else can we expect more from a TV series .... this is great
7,5.0,"It was excellent, The Cersei´s performance was right and good, Daenerys´arrival was dramatic and precious visually"
7,4.0,Started off fantastic but waned a bit towards the end of the episode. Much better start than last season! Looking forward to next week My favorite part of the episode was the opening scene...AMAZING OPENING SCENE!
7,4.5,"With all the praise it has received over the years, it is easy to criticize ""Game of Thrones."" Most will point out the dip in quality when it comes to the writing, dialog, and storytelling, since we've gotten further and further from the books. Even so, it doesn't stop this show from being great. With unmatched production value, great acting, incredible action, fascinating characters and political intrigue, and unparalleled mythos and lore, ""Game of Thrones"" stands alongside the greatest shows to ever air on television. While season 7 is certainly one of the weaker seasons, it proves something. Even on a bad day, ""Game of Thrones"" is better than most shows on a good day."
7,5.0,An exceptional show!!
7,5.0,"In a Season 7 premiere that spent substantial time setting up the 12 Thrones episodes that remain, Arya Stark (Maisie Williams) jumpstarts events with an opening shocker. The young assassin picks up where she left off, continuing a vengeance trip through Stark-killing House Frey that began last season, when she slit the throat of patriarch Walder (David Bradley) after feeding him a pie containing his mashed-up sons.

7,5.0,"Great introduction to the season, lays the groundwork for a lot to come and catches us up with most of the main characters. Let's hope that the rest of the season can build on this base and continue to raise the momentum."
7,4.5,"In its seventh season, Game of Thrones yet again earns its place among the greatest shows ever produced, although the support from George R. R. Martin's novels is noticeably absent."
7,3.5,"This new season of game of thrones promises a lot of death, war and drama between its characters. But i have to say, that even with that, this could never be at the high of the last 6 seasons"
7,5.0,"The winter is here madafakas!!, Game of Thrones all years bring us stories that make us cry, laugh and enjoy. This is probably the best season at the moment, compact and simple, but totally fulled of great storylines and perfomances, and the best visual and special effects Honestly the best!"
7,5.0,"Game of Thrones never disappoints, this season was full of moments we had never seen before, just when you think you have seen it all, you havent. This is the greatest series that ever was or ever will be. I expect many awards next year. The music is delightful as ever and the special effects reached a whole new level. Satisfying finale and a breathtaking ending scene."
7,5.0,"Game of Thrones really kicks it up a gear in its seventh season, and shows no signs of losing its seat in the throne of TV. It continues to deliver rich dialogue, spectacular battle sequences, and conflicting characters with believable motives. It is immensely satisfying to see events and reunions we have been waiting years for, and other shocking circumstances we could not have predicted."
7,5.0,Like the legendary one punch man's lackluster all definitive punch.....Dracarys just a huge fuck you on anything and everything else
7,5.0,I wish... this show would never end.
8,1.5,"Lacking the foundation of the books in which the series is based, the final seasons lack the expansive world building, sturdy storytelling and thorough character development that we have become accustomed with in the earlier seasons. The showrunners attempt at an all encompassing, entertaining and satisfying ending fall horribly flat."
8,3.5,"POSSIBLE SPOILERS AHEAD: I re-watched it after having watched it first when it came out. The time and years gave me a feeling that the plot direction and resolution WAS in fact better than I thought when i first watched it. It's very un-rewarding and demoralizing, which makes sense given what the show had given us throughout the years. It shouldn't have been this amazing ending with everything we wanted... it should be this bleak, unrewarding ending. That said though, the season still suffers from pacing and writing issues. A lot of illogical situations and weird loopholes - which really hurts it a lot more than the ending alone would have. It really needed those extra 2 episodes (AT LEAST) with preferably a whole extra season - to be truly rewarding to viewers."
8,0.5,I found this hilarious unlike the people I knew who were hoping this would end well
8,2.5,A very bad and disappointing last season of one of the best TV series of all time.
8,4.0,"Yes, it has flaws. But it still has a lot more than just that. With plotlines resolving, loose ends tied up, and the biggest conflicts in Westeros History, it delivers on the spectacle. It also is a rather poetic and fitting end for many characters. It dares to have some characters heel spin on their entire arc, but I think that was the point. This show established in it's first season that it's not afraid to break the rules, and in life sometimes, people revert back to their old self or give into their anger. However, there are also those characters who don't let that bring them down. They stay the course and do the right thing no matter what and overall, that's what life is. All we can do is our best, we just have to stay strong, especially in those times where others give in."
8,4.0,The Hound vs The Mountain is the most powerful scene in TV history.
8,4.0,"I have loved the whole show from season one to eight but... as much as it remained for me as a great spectacle I am sure that it might have been better if the last season was preceded by the book, as the script would have been better. Yes, there is that final character arc plot twist which got so much criticism... Well, like it or hate it, it's a done deal now, at least until the final book arrives. Good look J.R.R. Martin with finishing it! Looking back at all the series 1-8 - I've watched each episode two times and this series wasn't different. Go ahead, watch it and make up and give it your score if fantasy TV shows are your jam... I have noticed that the last season of the Game of Thrones has scored lower with the critics and the audiance than the season of the Rings of Power and I strongly disagree with it. This season with some shortcomings is still by all means watchable and fun with endeering characters and great scenes."
8,0.5,How absolutely dare they. Shattered expectations after a lengthily investment. Genuinely curious as to how the careers of David Benioff and D.B. Weiss are going now.
8,4.0,"I have re-watched the whole series and I must defend the last season a bit. Throughout every season we have been given clues at which way this will go, if, we watched closely, therefore saying that the ending was hurried or unsatisfactory doesn't give justice. The truth is, she didn't much change in the last season- she WAS all that along the way. However, like Tyrion said-when she was burning ""evil"" people everyone was okay with that. Eventually she turned against innocent people, or maybe they were evil too? Whose to decide? U start burning people based on your perception, soon enough u will start making terrible mistakes. She didn't actually ""lost"" her mind, she ""opended"" her real, hidden self. All the way she would burn cities, peoples to bring ""freedom"". That's just the thing, the line is thin. And it is your fault for believing she was anything else from the beginning. She wasn't, u just chose not to see. Now, if anyone won the game of thrones that would be for sure Sansa, getting independence for herself and North but most importantly-Jon. He never asked for any of it, he belong with free folks from the beginning and only he actually ""won"" the game. He left the world of Kings, Lords and rules. He and ghost belongs in the ""real"" north. If that's not a happy, satisfying ending for a glorious saga, then I don't know what is."
8,0.5,"Soul crushing. Devastating. Heartbreaking. These are the feelings experienced at the end. Any love had for the previous 7 seasons, instantly eviscerated and replaced with a feeling of wasted time and undeserving emotional investment. The ppl who created this monumental failure did so with not one single thought of the fans in mind, not one! Quickly closing a project they had already been paid for so they can move on their next big bank deposit is disgusting and unforgivable. I will never again allow my time to be wasted nor emotionally invest in any project with David Benioff and Dan Weiss involved. If you love GOT, do not watch this season, it will ruin all that came before it."
8,3.5,"Série muito boa, esse final seria ótimo se tivesse uma nona temporada, eu adorei todos os episódios da temporada(quase todos) mais o último transformou a Daenerys em louca em 25 minutos"
8,0.5,Season 8 of this series destroyed what would have been the greatest television show of my generation.
8,5.0,Love the show but end is not good
8,2.5,Main problem with S8 was that creators rushed the whole plot they should have continued for at least 10 seasons
8,3.0,"Mikey's TV Review: Game Of Thrones (Season 8) Since its TV debut in 2011, HBO's groundbreaking G.O.T has become a world wide phenomenon. Smashing viewing records and winning awards everywhere for writing, visual FX, music and acting. The shows legions of fans are passionate about it, almost devout. So it surprised no-one that the final season came under some intense and fierce scrutiny - especially online. Although the resulting backlash, while not wholly unjustified, was perhaps a little harsh. After a slow burning start, we get one of the most intense battles ever committed to film. Bloody, realistic and visceral. If anything lets this down it's the unusual use of dark lighting. Some scenes are so badly lit it really is impossible to see who is fighting who. After the entire show build up to this moment, it seems a strange decision. Particularly when the visuals (when you can see them) are a true delight. That said, the climax to the battle is immensely satisfying, and a cathartic moment for a beloved character. Elsewhere, the acting continues to be stellar throughout. The cast now so thoroughly emerged into their roles, it will be an almost impossible task for them to be seen performing anything else. True, with only 6 episodes this time round, the ending feels a little rushed. The female leads are somewhat short changed in their final scenes (especially death scenes), while a couple of left field 'surprises' almost undo all of the good work (and good will) the show has built over its 8 year run. However, almost all of the main cast get to complete some kind of believable story arc without ever feeling completely out of character. Another 4 episodes might have rectified many of the unfinished, dropped and never further explored story strands, but this is all we have. As such, it's just fine. Hardly the ending many of us expected or wanted. Or perhaps, we just don't want to say ""goodbye""? The fact that the show itself has pushed television boundaries in storytelling and production, shouldn't be overlooked. To continue at such a high standard for so long is an achievement in itself. It opened the doors to a host of new talent and even more groundbreaking fantasy shows such as The Boys, Watchmen, and The Expanse. The nerds have inherited the earth! Well, the 'world of entertainment' at least. Should HBO ever decide to revisit Westeros (in another 10 years or so), I'd be more than happy to pay it a visit. Until then, I can watch it all again from the very beginning. Winter Is Coming... Mikey's TV Rating: Season 8: 3/5* / Seasons 1-7: 4/5*"
8,5.0,Allot of people did not like the finale but given that they have to go off script as book wasn't finish I feel they did ok. As for the whole show I think this is one of the best shows I ever watch as every episode builds out in intensity and character development leaving you wanting more as every episode ends.
8,5.0,"Uma das maiores forças de ""Game of Thrones"" foi sua capacidade de desafiar as expectativas dos espectadores, entregando reviravoltas chocantes e momentos imprevisíveis. É claro que, como qualquer obra de arte, ""Game of Thrones"" tem seus críticos e momentos controversos, mas sua influência na televisão moderna é indiscutível. Porém ainda sim sendo a melhor serie ja feita."
8,2.5,"This season was bad… not really a better way to explain it. Before you take my words out of context, this was still better than most show's finales. The obvious issues with this season is that the producers wanted to release the season before the writer finished the book. As someone who strongly supports following the book lore for show content…. *cough* Rings of Power *cough* I still don't think this season was a ""Monstrosity"". I have 2 main reasons why I hated this season and that is 1. It took two years to produce and it was only 6 episodes were released that were longer than average filled with random filler pieces… AND 2. Everything felt rushed and the build up that has been going on for 6-7 seasons was euthanized. As for the dragon queen flipping a switch, if you paid attention throughout the series you knew that was coming. Great storyline but F- execution for the big screen on the last season…. I'm sorry but this season deserves a weak review after what was given to us in the previous seasons ¯\_(ツ)_/¯"
8,3.0,Rushed full of action but missing the dialogue and backstabbing that the series was built on. Fans would've preferred to have waited than get a CGI filled war with little in the way of content.
8,1.0,"A disappointing ending diminishes the overall viewing experience, leaving you with a sense of unfulfilled investment."
8,2.0,This season was not good at all I did not like how the different story's ended and just underwhelming. I don't like what they did with jon and I hate what they did with danny overall 4.3/10
8,1.0,"Four years later and still one of the most crushing failures in delivery ever put to film. My advise if you're considering watching S8, is to sit down and write S8 yourself, and consider that the canon ending. And never, ever, under any circumstances, watch this show's conclusion. The incredible efforts by the cast and crew cannot be overstated. The acting is superb, the cinematography, and settings are flawless. At the very least it is a visual spectacle. The actors are superb in their delivery. The CG is well crafted. The practical effects are on par or surpass some of the best productions of all time. Season 8s failures do not rest on the gifted men and women in production. Choices signed off by producers, and the show runners and writers are solely responsible for this failure. The list in which Season 8 is difficult to summarize in a short review."
8,0.5,It was a travesty that writers who lost interest in telling the story of the books after the fourth season stayed on to ruin a brilliant show.
8,3.0,What an ending! It definitely hurt the show.
8,0.5,"Complete waste of time, because of the finale. Disappointed."
8,3.0,Gave one of the best shows ever created...one of the worst endings ever created.
8,0.5,"Trash! They ruined it! This season made absolutely no sense, it's hard to believe that the same people made this season. If I can say anything good, it's that the cinematography was movie level good, when it wasn't too dark to see it."
8,4.0,Awesome..............
8,1.5,"Great music, cinematography, acting, set and costume design, CGI, and fight choreography. Basically, great everything *but* the writing."
8,2.0,"I loved this show so, SO much. But this Season 8 was horribly rushed, written, and directed. Shame on the creators for butchering it. Of all times for them to go full-dumbass, they chose the last season. If they had finished strong and done things right, this would've been unquestionably the greatest show ever. It'll still be one of my top favorite shows of all time, but the sour and infuriating way they ended it has forever stained it. Ugh, frustrating."
8,0.5,"A cautionary tale for showrunners everywhere. If your heart isn't in it, step aside and let someone else try. All characters lose all sense of logic. Only Theon has a decent story arc in the end."
8,0.5,"OMG it was so, so good, until the last season, and then the ending episode... Was it written by children? Character assassination across the board with total indignities for all of the main characters. All the issues that plagued the season are force multiplied in this last nonsensical treatment which nailed the coffin shut with a lazy and crass transition from political intrigue, alliances and betrayals to poor quality effects and battles. A total insult to the audience that will go down in history."
8,0.5,I will never forgive DD for what they've done to this incredible show.
8,0.5,After spending years on this series the final season made me realise it was all for nothing. For me Game of Thrones ended in the 6th season an then it got cancelled.
8,3.0,"Melhor série do mundo, mas eu odeio esse final com todas as minhas forças! O que vocês fizeram com a nossa rainha Daenerys é imperdoável!!!!!!!"
8,5.0,A brilliant and underrated conclusion to the series. Loved it.
8,1.0,"4 years later and this is still, by far, the most disappointing, poorly-thought-out, lazy, nonsensical, and flat-out awful conclusion to a once-fantastic TV series that I have ever had the displeasure of watching. The acting and music is great as always, but every single decision the show runners made with the plot and characters is insulting to the integrity of the show and intelligence of the fans. This final season truly ruined my fandom of the show and universe in a way I didn't think was possible. I can't even go back and rewatch old episodes knowing how much of a let down and disservice the final season was. Ruined nearly every character for me. A 12 year old on crack who had read a brief summary of the show and characters could have written a more satisfactory ending than D&D."
8,0.5,um final forçado para tentar surpreender o publico porem só consegui-o que destruísse todo o carinho de quem tinha acompanhado ao longo do ano toda a sga antológica da série
8,0.5,The ending was very wierd and ridiculous
8,1.5,"What should have been one of the greatest fantasy epics known to film and television, ended up being a lazy, illogical, and rushed mess with the worst possible choice for ruler of the Seven Kingdoms."
8,0.5,Unacceptable how it was done
8,3.5,"I think season 8 gets a bad wrap because of how incredibly good seasons 1-7 were. Before this season Game of Thrones was as close to flawless as you can get. But this season had a ton of issues. For me the issues start with pacing. Everything felt rushed. It felt like they crammed 2-3 seasons worth of material into 5 or 6 episodes which really made it hard to buy into the story or believe what was happening. Some of the characters flip on a dime and a lot of times it did not feel consistent with their characters over the course of the series. Which leads me to the next flaw: lazy writing. My issues were not me not liking who sits on the throne, what happens to Jon and Dany, ect. Just that everything felt rushed and it was lazily executed. With that said the Long Night episode was fantastic to watch when it premired. Trulily felt like an event and it was a ""sit on the edge of your seat"" kind of episode. Every episode before that was also successful in my opinion. But the events that followed just felt extremely rushed and lazily executed. The acting is fantastic, the action and sets are superb, but the pacing and inconsistencies in stories make it by far the weakest season of the show. 6.5/10"
8,4.5,"Os fãs só não perceberam que todos os finais foram cantados durante a série na tv. Todos os desfechos foram dados de forma sensata com as temporadas anteriores e não do jeito que a maioria queria ver. Mudaria alguns detalhes, mas foram coerentes com o próprio roteiro"
8,3.5,"While the last season of GoT is the most controversial, I liked the ending. It fit with the rest of the story. That said, it certainly wasn't perfect. It felt a little rushed. Still, it ended on a solid note."
8,0.5,Horrible ending. Rushed and no resolution brought to multiple storylines. Worst final season for a truly brilliant series.
8,2.0,It had everything to be the best series Daenerys Targaryen was being well developed but the writers decided to throw everything in the trash with this horrible ending
8,0.5,"This series took a giant leap in quality downward from season 4 onward, with each season worse than the last, every character by season 8 is destroyed. Each character had a gradual and believable arc through seasons 1 to 4, and by season 8 the way they talk, act, and their motivations are so alien to who these characters were it's hard to believe this wasn't some weird adaptation of invasion of the body snatchers. It's so comically bad, it has to be seen to be believed, and even then you'll still be in disbelief."
8,0.5,The worst season of any series i have ever watched. It was downright insulting. Never seen such a big franchise become so unpopular that quickly.
8,0.5,The Long Night was one helluva joke.
8,0.5,Still angry that D&D managed to ruin this series. The ending itself wasn't the problem but the way they got there with lazy writing and so on just sucks.
8,1.5,"After 7 seasons of interesting storylines, this final season felt rushed, empty, and logically broken. Such a shame to ruin several years of intrigue with such a vacuous and insulting finale."
8,0.5,"Not much of a fantasy kind of guy but throughout the show I did enjoy some of what this show had to offer however the last two episodes were written very poorly and did not give all the characters the satisfying ending they deserved. When the whitewalkers came in the beggining episode although the fight scenes were good, there was no light couldn't see jack squat. So in conclusion good show with an unsatisfactory ending."
8,4.0,awesome but had to few episodes shoukd have stayed with format of 10 episodes each - Rushed
8,1.0,"In the final season of Game of Thrones, everything that has been built up to this point gets quickly dismissed and the final episode does not conclude anything, leaving the viewer unsatisfied. It's a shame how the events unfold, everything feels rushed, I feel like the show needed a couple more seasons."
8,1.0,Malísima. Final malísimo
8,1.0,"Season 8 was disappointing. The mighty Dothrakis charged outside castle parameter ALONE and far from others was not making sense at all and they should learn from Mance Rayder,to built the biggest fire in the North knowing they are facing the Army of the Dead and the night is DARK. Disappointed with the storyline."
8,1.5,Honestly one of the worse shows ever who ever wrote it has a fetish for murder and nudity unjust constant go watch vikings instead they
8,0.5,"Everything in this season was terrible, stemming from disinterested and incompetent writing"
8,4.5,"Season 8 finishes Game of Thrones in an epic fashion! The battles were epic (but probably could have used better lighting). I felt like the plot twists all made sense and kept the show from becoming too predictable. While Bran becoming king was certainly kind of hard to believe, I think the endings for all the other characters were very fitting and satisfying and ended the series off on the right note."
8,3.5,"I gave 3 and a half stars only for the direction and actors' performances. The writing was awful! They ruined Daenerys, Jon, Jamie even Tyrion characters. The way they ended the Night King plot was so rushed. No final battle between Night King and Jon which I wanted to see. They could have done much better with the storyline."
8,1.5,It was all for nothing
8,2.0,Here's a tip.. stop at Season 7. this season was rushed poorly written the last series should of been the one you remember but it was just average season 1-7 was solid.
8,1.0,"First 2 episodes weren't bad, then the battle stupidity of 3 happened, then it managed to get even worse."
8,0.5,"They were able to almost destroy one of the best TV series, in only 6 episodes. There is nothing left of the great story telling. Unexpected plot twist, which made this show great, were either obvious or completely rediculous. Even the special effects were bad."
8,2.0,"Its mind-bogling how Game of Thrones went from being the best drama-action fiction story to what almost felt like a generic superhero movie. I would give a higher rating if this was an Avengers movie or something. Some action scenes were great, but the amount of plot armor and cliché moments just makes you feel like this isn't Game of Thrones anymore. Where before characters' decisions mattered and had consequences, now plot armor is everywhere only for the good of ""epicness"" or a plot goal."
8,0.5,This drama ruined the story of seven seasons. I felt ridiculed when I watched the whole eight seasons.
8,1.0,"Knowing how bad the last season was going to be, I still was shocked that it continued to disappoint. Characters make decisions that do not fit their personality, and plot armor is suddenly a thing in a show that is not afraid to kill its main characters."
8,0.5,"Season 8 was so poorly written and rushed that it's best not watched at all. ...Since so many new shows today are sequels or prequels to an already established franchise, I have a suggestion that I think would have a ready made large audience and be both a financial and -hopefully- artistic success. Ignore this travesty of a 6 episode final season, Rewrite it in the spirit and quality of the previous 7 seasons and conclude Game of Thrones correctly in -say- 12 episodes. Probably some of the players will have to be recast, but that's OK. It would garner a lot of viewer interest and provide a final season that is worthy of the franchise."
8,0.5,Just re-watched this season as I had been avoiding it since it first aired (and devastated me by how utterly rubbish it was)....unfortunately it hasn't improved with the second watch. What a terribly disappointing way to end an otherwise fantastic show. The writers / producers etc should be embarrassed.
8,1.0,"All of that battling, just to hand it over in the very end???"
8,5.0,"Truly a spectacular finale season with by far the biggest b*lls for such dark twists & turns. Clearly only those who understood Game of Thrones will know it was NEVER meant to be a crowd pleaser like Star Wars, Harry Potter, Marvel, LotR, etc. This story was always meant to be dark and anti-happy ending. The truth is what's right for its story isn't what's always right for the masses. Think Romeo & Juliet! If that story was done today for the first time with its ending, audiences would've called it (so-called) bad writing, all that nonsense. I'm so glad this season won Best Drama Series at the Emmies and broke TV history records - those who know how to do REAL research will know the truth of this and not believe all the fake stories and lies about this season + showrunners. I still can't believe how many id**ts fall / claim that fake story of the season being rushed coz of starwars - the showrunners announced there would only be XX number of episodes left way back in 2016 FFS! I repeat, 2016! Just look up REAL articles from the past and you'll find that news. What's more is SO many don't realize that the author GRRM told the showrunners his ending as early as 2013 when season 3 was being made! This is proven in the official book Fire Cannot Kill a Dragon! Now that's btw an actual book with credible information instead of all the countless lies on the d*mb internet. I still laugh when people BS saying the showrunners kicked GRRM out - he only left bcoz there was NO more books to adapt and he kept saying he'd be ready with the next book before season 5 was made. He failed, it's that simple and he just left the showrunners in a tough spot. No one (as in those trolling haters) ever want to admit that! So I ask this simple question - how could the showrunners ever go to 10+ seasons when again, there were NO more books to adapt from?? Apparently many (rather, just the haters) dont use their brains to figure that out. They also btw took 2 years to make season 8 (only 6 episodes)! If you're supposedly in a rush, why spend 2 years??! Many don't realize that they used to take JUST 1 year to do EACH of the earlier seasons (10 episodes each!). Food for thought!"
8,3.5,"Game Of Thrones is possibly the best series ever made, however, the last season is too rushed. A missed opportunity for this 90%+ rated series. Nevertheless, still a great watch as the previous 7 seasons give an outstanding foundation."
8,0.5,One of the worst endings in history.
8,4.0,"In my opinion, this season got far more hate than it deserved. Sure, not perfect, but still entertaining to watch."
8,0.5,"Completely lost what made the show work in the initial seasons. Every scene was rushed, half the episodes are so dark you cannot see whats hapening and instead of focusing on plot and story the focus became costumes and cast crushes."
8,0.5,"Season 8 of Game of Thrones may very well be the most insulting and offensive finale ever achieved for a beloved television series. The horrendous writing and aimless plot construction utterly destroy everything the series worked towards up to this point. Even if the other 7 seasons were flawless (they aren't), the pile of filth that is Season 8 does far too much damage to the series as a whole. Benioff and Weiss should be humiliated at what they signed off on and presented to the world in this conclusion."
8,1.0,"What an awful way to ruin a legacy. This final season was pretty much a slap in the face and takes a huge dump on fan's foreheads. Most of the episodes were dry, boring or just plain drawn way the heck out. Very seldom actual enjoyable parts. You'd be better of not watching it and envisioning your own conclusion of how you'd like it to end because it would be much better than this horsey doo doo. Just plain bad!"
8,5.0,"I confess that the first season was badass to hurt, but it was more badass in the middle of the end of the series, very good."
8,1.0,An absolute classic of a show ruined by the most deflating conclusion imaginable. Nonsensical decisions and neglectful writing left me opting not to watch House of the Dragon because I know what that prequal ultimately leads to.
8,1.0,"An absolute, unequivocally spectacular fall from grace."
8,0.5,"8 seasons waiting for a epic fight, and is the night we cant see anything and end"
8,0.5,"Season 8 of GoT will certainly go down as an Epic Failure of Monumental Proportions. Bards will sing many a tale of the Dark Winter that Dan & Dave brought upon the world with this monstrosity of hubris, disrespect (to the story, characters, and fans), and lunacy."
8,3.5,Honestly I can forgive the fact they actually try to do something original with some bold choices but the beginning feels rushed and there where some inconsistences in the writting.
8,1.0,"Rushed, horribly written, every character contradicts himself, every plot line is forgotten, the sense of time is lost, Cgi gets worse, the battles are horrible, the emotional impact is near 0. Worst season of tv I've ever seen"
8,0.5,Writing : 2/10 Acting : 4/10 Cinematography : 6/10 Costume design : 7/10 Set design : 7/10 CGI Effects 8/10 Artistic vision 1/10 Adaptation ranking : 1/10
8,5.0,"Don't know why everyone hated the final season. It was a but rushed but Dany was always evil and she inherited the ""mad gene"". I don't know what characters people are talking about to flesh out?, there were little to no one else they could flesh out im very confused lol. There were some mistakes but something tells me you guys would never be satisfied."
8,0.5,Really feel like if they could have given Ayra another 20 minutes of running aimlessly around trying to avoid falling buildings (or fluffing time... take your pick) it would have definitely redeemed what is now the historic final season of any show. Honestly thought the Night King climax in EP 3 was great (minus not being able to see half of it due to it being so dark) however after that it was the world's most epic shite show.
8,4.0,I thought it was good. Lot's of people won't be happy but I enjoyed watching the end of this series.
8,0.5,Last season is so bad I regret watching the previous seven. Feels like an unfinished story.
8,3.0,"The first episodes were great but once that battle ended, the rest of the season went downhill."
8,0.5,Season 8 sucked. Bad writing. I felt like I wasted my life. Season 8 ruined the whole show even though earlier seasons were great. writers rushed the season to end it quick and lot of character developments ruined due to inconsistent writing and once again writers rushing everything to end it. The few ppl that like it are brainless and they just like bad writing. It so bad. Anticlimactic.
8,0.5,"HORRIBLE! It doesn't even deserve half this star. The writers bashed this show, I hope they won't get other opportunities to work on other shows because they will ruin it just like they ruined Game of Thrones. Competent writers should rewrite this season"
8,1.5,"The end of one of the most important characters just as Cersei or Daenerys is completely outrageous, also in general the end was completely without context, leaving Bran a character not very well explored or used as the king"
8,4.0,"I actually liked the way the series ended. Daenarys was way too cruel, and wouldn't have made a good ruler."
8,0.5,Conseguiram destruir a serie com o último episódio.
8,1.5,"Started out really great but slowly starts getting more convoluted. The characters' arcs that were build up on seven seasons are now wasted and disregarded. I really wanted to love this season but it felt so rush and stale. D and D really dropped the ball on this one by deciding to ""direct"" a new Star Wars trilogy which they didn't even plan on doing."
8,2.5,"The 1st episode is the good... unfortunately it's going downhill from that point. The Long Night being one of the worst since it's so dark, I can hardly able to see who's doing what in the TV Screen. Tried to rewatch it again on Ipad, and it's still hard. The last 2 episode, brought down the previous great 7 season to the level of soap opera that emphasize for dramatize ending. All of the character developments throughout previous seasons means nothing."
8,1.0,"Big stupid twists are misguidedly made for the stupid thinking of ""subverting expectations"". And, the writing's sucks. If season 8 is an adventure, both the journey and the destination are one big field of shit with various explosions and stench throughout."
8,0.5,"Couldn't have been any more rushed. Complete character arcs thrown away and huge plot points that would have taken seasons to build up to, now thrown at the audience in mere minutes. For me the ending is so bad and rushed that it almost takes away the rewatch ability of the entire series. it's 7 seasons of build up that lead to an unsatisfying climax with little closure on many of the shows big questions. We find many plot points left unexplored and this for me was a spit in the face after many years of anticipation."
8,1.0,"Game of Thrones was originally one of my all-time favorites, but tragically this final season destroyed all the goodwill it built up after all this time. Seasons 1-6 were absolutely fantastic (5 and 6 despite their flaws still had some fantastic moments) but after Season 7 I really was worried about the end as written by D&D. It's infuriating that they completely ruined what could have been the greatest ending to a show ever and left it a laughable mess. I will never forgive them for that."
8,5.0,"Everyone clearly was not watching this clearly. Dany was always bad, we just liked why she did it before. I thought this ended great."
8,0.5,The last season in particular tanked the show. Throwing out all the complex plot lines that had been set up in the first few seasons never got resolved.
8,4.0,"Generally pretty much up to standard with most of the rest of the seasons in my book and kept me guessing as to who would be King to rule 'em right up to end (I was totally wrong), so I really don't get all the hate thrown at the final series (Disappointed fellow wrong guessers? ""Tied to conventional endings"" folk? Dragon Queen fanboys? Fave-character cheerleaders? ""Can I have some more Oliver Twisters"", Who knows...?). OK, I could have done with less of the Long Night horror show (though, to be frank, I wasn't a fan of the whole undead sub-plot thang anyway) and, yes, some folk did a lot of travelling very quickly, but for me the character arcs worked, the dialogue rarely disappointed, surprises were unleashed, the heart was wrenched (even for folks for whom it it shouldn't have been) and the effects were staggering. Thoroughly recommended.."
8,5.0,Wow what can I say. The whole series is an absolute masterclass can't believe iv only just watched it. So many epic moments so many likeable characters and hated ones. Each story delivered to near perfection. Arya stark is my hero. A must watch for pretty much anyone. Bravo my favourite series iv ever watched.
8,0.5,"[Spoilers] I hated episodes 4-6, I personally feel that they should've just somehow stuck Jon on the Throne after revealing himself as the true heir. I mean they tried to do like a 720 degree turn after they already did a 360 with Jon being a Targaryen. Also, Bran was in like what... half a dozen episodes?. Nobody was able to really get to like him and want to see him take the Throne since he was in like no episodes, it just doesn't really make any sense. I don't understand how the directors couldn't see that it was going to be the downfall of GoT, along with everything else in the last couple episodes. I was just really heartbroken after I just watched over 73 hours of GoT. I loved the show like everyone else."
8,0.5,"An absolutely horrifyingly bad end to a great series. The rushed ill-conceived story made me feel guilty for wasting years of watching the show. The signs were there from season 6 onwards, gone was the unpredictability, the main characters all forged their plot-armour and developed the ability to teleport across Westeros. The strength of the show, built on the books (I assume having not read them), was that the characters were all at the mercy of external events in a cruel and unpredictable world where they were often behind current events, as would be the case in a world without telecommunications or rapid transport. The show-runners seemed not to grasp this, as soon as they ran out of books to base it on they threw out everything that made the show great."
8,0.5,"So badly done... how they film it, dragging scenes out and focusing on the wrong things. The idea of the story and end is good, but they slaughter the series"
8,0.5,"Barf!!! The writers for the final season of GOT should find another purpose in life, yes that bad! Thanks for wasting everyone's time! Oh yeah, why exactly did it take years to make this utter piece of crap....."
8,3.5,"I must say it was the worst of the 8 seasons of this series. It was poor because the plot was rushed to the finish. I think the first 3 episodes of this final season were actually done quite well and if they ran this to 10 episodes and elaborated on the timeline between the Night King and King's Landing, it could have been better. If you have watched through season 7, you must watch for the ending... but it could have been leaps and bounds better... 6.5-7/10"
8,2.5,What the hell happen to the story? Did they run out of ideas without Martin's storyline?
8,3.0,They destroyed the emotion in just this season.
8,4.0,"Game of Thrones, for the majority of his run, change the game on how genre television can be done. I'm not a huge fan of the fantasy genre but, I am a fan of good television. The show, up until the last season constantly delivered. The visual facts and acting were superb. As this series moved on into the latter part of this run, you didn't notice a little bit of a dip in writing quality. However, the show did remain in good quality. The last season, though still good, took the biggest dive in quality. It felt extremely rushed and didn't capitalize on all the groundwork the previous seasons had laid. Do I was satisfied with the ultimate finale, I felt like they left a lot of story out."
8,2.0,"Everytime I remember this season exists, I also have an urge to google when the books will come out so I can erase what happened"
8,0.5,"Well if you think there can not be worse than this, just a try Rings of Power"
8,4.0,Best fantasy TV Show ever made.
8,2.0,Very badly written ending.
8,1.0,"COME ON!!!!!! All the times I think of rewatching GOT I think of the last season and it has ruined it. I wish I could unwatch it, totally wrecks everything."
8,3.0,The story felt rushed and the battles were too long. A bit disappointing end to a very good series.
8,0.5,I like to pretend this season doesn't exist
8,2.5,"No, why did you do this to the serie?"
8,1.5,Last season is a complete joke. No attention paid for the characters. Wasted away a good story and its momentum.
8,3.0,"Game of Thrones' final season shortchanges the women of Westeros, sacrificing satisfying character arcs for spectacular set-pieces in its mad dash to the finish line."
8,2.5,"Some nicely handled moments combined with the technical brilliance on display and great acting makes season 8 an overall fine watch, but here unfortunately, it is dragged down by rushed storytelling and poor handling of the main characters, shocking the audience without giving though-provoking or even compelling reasoning."
8,2.5,"The one episode i loved was episode 3 The long night. the rest was just not good, it felt apart,"
8,0.5,Rushed the best show of all time
8,0.5,If the showrunners had taken their time for the final the serie could have been the best... but unfortunatly they are dumb and dumber
8,0.5,"After years of build-up and some of the best storytelling on TV, the writers completely drop the ball with this disappointing final season. What more can I say that hasn't been echoed by thousands of critics and fans across the internet. I just hope any studio or network will think twice before ever working with David Benioff or D. B. Weiss again."
8,3.0,What an awful way to end such a good show. You can just tell how rushed this entire season felt. The only reason I am rating this season this high and not any lower is that I do think this season does have a few quality moments and I think many of these moments would have worked if they actually did a better job building up to them. But almost everything that was built up from the previous 7 seasons now meant nothing after this season. A truly disappointing ending to such a great show.
8,1.0,"Just re-watched the show and last season is even worse than I remembered. Rotten tomatoes should rate it for what it is ( at least 30) and HBO should re-shoot it. Every episode is bad, not just the last one. Pure shame that they didn't understand the show they were shooting."
8,0.5,Truly a spectacle on how to literally write your show into oblivion and have pop culture completely forget you and your work.
8,0.5,How could you destroy everything with such a dull meaningless last episodes? Characters suddenly behave in a way they never did before. After episode 3 things go really downhill. The climax was already reached with the dead of the Winter King... the rest is just meah.
8,1.5,Terrible writing and completely destroyed the series as a whole.
8,0.5,I would give this no stars if it was possible.
8,2.0,This is a rating for the show overall it became a mess after Season 4 - 5 due to them running out of Source Material the recent seasons ruin the old episodes due to the ending & storylines becoming so shit since you have nothing to look forward to.
8,1.5,Slap in the face for the fans. Hot mess of garbage after a banquet of 6-7 seasons of excellence... V disappointing.
8,0.5,What can I say that hasn't been said before? this season is a total lack of respect for the audience!.
8,0.5,"Welcome to rock bottom. All the money the studio threw at this couldn't buy them a decent story. We have bombastic set-pieces, flashy special effects and supposedly emotional moments. I could not help but laugh at how bad this is. Characters make dumb choices all the time, previously invincible beings can now be easily killed off, only to reverse back to normal in the next episode. Characters and armies teleport all over the continent, just as the writers need them to. This is probably the most expensive dumpster fire I have ever seen on TV, but Amazon is trying their best to beat HBO on that with ""Rings of Power"", I guess. What a waste of time and creative energy."
8,1.0,Insincere directorial!
8,0.5,"This was just bad. This series overall is amazing, and the underlying books are even better, but the showrunners Dave and Dan have done a major disservice to the fans with this garbage. How can this be the same show as the first six seasons? If these guys didn't want to keep making the show, they should have passed it off to other showrunners. There was an offer for that, but they were too egocentric to take it. This season has again condensed about 15 episodes worth of story, but this time into only 6 episodes. It's rushed. Too many major plot points are left unresolved. The ending is terrible. It's hard to say that about I series I love so much, but this is the truth. I believe those trying to defend it are like me in that they want to accept that something they love so much has ended so poorly. However the sad truth is that this season is unsatisfying and an absolute insult to the fans who have invested their time into the series."
8,0.5,Once they published books ended and the source material dried up it's like the producers and writers had nothing left to say and they utterly returned to predictable boring scripts and destroyed the character arcs. Why did Arya go to the house of black-and-white and become one of the faceless man what was the point of Gendry with the bull helmet. Don't get me started on Daenerys because the final season was completely out of character for her for anyone that read the books. The whole story started with the white walkers north of the wall and the baby being taken to make another white walker basically skipped over. About the only satisfying character arc was the Clegane brothers. So many things wrong with the final season HBO should fork out the money to redo season seven and eight as full seasons. I can go on with all the things wrong with the end of the series and HBO should honestly be ashamed they let the brothers ruin it.
8,1.5,"I dun wan it, you are muh qwean"
8,0.5,"They kill dayneris, he destroyed they show"
8,3.5,"I know most people hated this ending, but tbh I didn't. I thought it was pretty good."
8,0.5,Season 8 was beyond horrible! Sad because the first 5 seasons where a 9/10 for me
8,0.5,"Just stop after season 4, you'll enjoy the show more."
8,1.0,Imagine spending 7 seasons building up meaningful characters so that you can troll your audience by throwing it all away in the last one.
8,2.0,While most of the season was...ok. The ending was just rushed and could have been so much more impactful. It still feels like the show never got a true ending.
8,1.5,"Oof, what a bad ending to an otherwise great series. The actions of some of the protagonists are just mindblowingly stupid. The only saving grace in the final season was the great ending to the character arc of the Hound and Sir Jorah."
8,3.0,"Poor, when compared to the first four seasons, and even when compared to the 7th. But still above average."
8,2.0,"Although the visual effects and performances are top-notch, nearly all the big creative decisions is a mistake. White Walkers, the threat that has been build throughout 7 seasons, defeated in only one depicted battle south of the wall, and their leader killed in an anticlimactic way by the most unexpected character, Arya (still hard to believe); Daenerys, one likable protagonist since season 1, suddenly struck by some psychosis and became a villain; and a cripple with some weird power ascend the throne to rule Seven (Six) Kingdoms. All that make up for a hugely disappointing resolution to a great series."
8,0.5,"GoT season 1 is one of the best seasons of any show, GoT Season 8 is one of the worst"
8,1.0,"Horrible way to end the series. No resolution, no explanation, no depth to the character. I can understand the way Deaneries, and Bran characters ended up there but there was no background or explanation to getting there. Lazy screenwriting without logic or proper story telling."
8,2.0,"Dan & Dave should forever feel the scorn they so richly deserve after the horrible final season, of what to that point had been one of the best shows running. They proved they didn't have the patience, desire, or understanding to bring GRR Martin's Magnum Opus to a fitting end. Not to mention, destroying the central plot of the series. Turns out that without GRR Martin's direct involvement and guidance, Dan & Dave weren't capable of carrying the show. Sadly, for those of us who love the story."
8,2.0,A great series ruined by its ending. Its clear that the quality nose dived when the show outran the books. They had just managed to fix the unnecessary sexposition and we were set for an epic end when it all fell apart.
8,0.5,mortacci vostra. Poco altro da dire.
8,0.5,At least D&D lost their chance at Star Wars after utterly ruining this show in their haste to move on to that project - ironic.
8,0.5,"Gosh this season ruined the whole experience. I often like to rewatch good shows and movies, but this show I hesitate, as I know I will have to see this in the end."
8,0.5,Worst season ending of a show in television history. This season made 0 sense and didn't fit the character arcs or tone of the story in seasons 1-7.
8,0.5,"So obvious they were clueless without the author's storytelling. All gloss and zero content. Dreadful ending to an amazing series. So very bad, Disney hastily dropped all plans of them making the next Star Wars movie."
8,1.5,"Overall ending for some of the characters are rather understandable and totally logic. On the other side, those who actually made the show special and build up in them, those characters were butchered and it felt like it was done in a hurry. Poor choice of direction."
8,0.5,a derailed fiasco; shame on the showrunners
8,1.5,"The inescapable weight of the characters narratives is fully felt this season, with almost every single one having either a rushed or completely lackluster end to their story. Season 8 absolutely fails to deliver on a satisfying conclusion for every single character in its ensemble, and is now infamous due to its failure. I still adore and love the series as a whole, but it's basically impossible to look back on it in a positive light with how butchered the ending turned out to be. In both Catholicism and the Faith of the Seven, patience is one of the holiest virtues, and the showrunners had absolutely none left for Game of Thrones. The result is the saddest and most heartbreaking endings to a series I have seen, and for entirely the wrong reasons."
8,0.5,"Like morning Dew to washing left on the Line overnight, Weiss and co hooked this one hard!"
8,2.0,"Game of Thrones used to be much better than this. You could say season 8 was a complete disappointment for most people that watched the series. The quality dropped off by a lot and it just wasn't that engaging on this last season, compared to seasons 1-7."
8,1.0,"Terrible way to end a franchise. I had watched each season up to season 7 and had to say I loved them but the season 8, wow was absolutely terrible. What a waste of something that was so magical and something that I whole-heartedly loved for years. Can't even imgine what on earth were the writers and the producers thinking. Worst ending I had ever watched. What a terrible waste."
8,0.5,"Uno scempio, una sola stagione capace di rovinare un'intera saga, solo per la fretta di concludere. Una trama che fa acqua da tutte le parti, personaggi stravolti, incoerente, pessimo. Sono riusciti a rovinare lo spettacolo del secolo."
8,0.5,"Way to end a franchise with such a bad taste in the mouth. I had bought each season up to season 7 and had rewatched every season multiple times leading up to season 8. HOWEVER, after the final episode aired, I have yet to buy the last season or even touch any of the previous seasons again in over 3 years. The motivation to rewatch this series is dead because of how badly they ended it. What a waste of something that was so magical and something that I whole-heartedly loved for years. Thank you Weiss and Benioff for caring more about a Star Wars show you never got and crapping on GOT fans instead."
8,5.0,Absolutely brilliant loved it the mix of medieval theme and fantasy and white walkers horror it's brilliant and love it and the battle Sean's are amazing and brings the horror of battle to life like I've never seen before on a historical battlefields and dialogue all brilliant however I would of liked to have seen John snow on the throne as king
8,0.5,"The only season that is properly rated... I mean... 55% is still too high for this overrated pile of garbage but I guess with time people will finally think ""Huh... I guess I was being a pretencious fuck by pretending to like this show."" and finally give it the -10% all seasons deserve."
8,5.0,Greater ending!!! I missed this GOAT series Game of Thrones one of the best series world !!!
8,1.5,Kudos to the cast and crew (save D&D) of Game of Thrones and GRRM for this show even though this season wants you to never watch it again. It'll always remain one of the greatest shows ever created.
8,1.0,Thought I rated every season of GoT but guess not. So disappointed. Not sure what the writers were thinking. They should redo the last season.
8,1.0,"It will be hard rewatching the series knowing how terrible the final season is. This unimaginably awful season has marked the entire series, which used to be regarded as one of the greatest of all time. What a disappointment."
8,0.5,"Qué pena me dio el final de una de las mejores series de la historia. Hoy en día casi nadie la recuerda. Final atropellado, mal escrito, personajes mal llevados (John Snow tiene menos carisma que un árbol en S8...). Nada de lo que ocurre tiene sentido alguno. Decisiones de guión que carecen de coherencia, personajes queridos y con potencial arruinados por la poca creatividad y visión de sus showrunners. Tendrían que haber hecho una temporada adicional. S8 centrandose en Cersei y S9 con los white walkers. Cualquier fan de GOT hubiese hecho un mejor final... una pena. Espero que D&D no vuelvan a tocar un producto cinematográfico o parecido en su vida, por el bien común."
8,5.0,"Yes, I wanted a different ending, but I've watched season 8 three times and it gets better each time. It's epic even with a conclusion I wished was different. Looking back you can see it was not entirely unexpected. The signs were there."
8,5.0,esta temporada final defrauda a los fans donde se sacrifican los arcos de los personajes por un final rapido y sin ideas
8,5.0,The greatest final 8 episodes ever!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
8,0.5,"Increíblemente decepcionante como acabaron con esta serie, tenia las mas grandes esperanzas de ver algo épico como las antiguas temporadas pero nos dejaron con un final mediocre, todos los personajes principales merecían un final digno, en cambio obtuvieron algo meh. Si iban a entregar un final así mejor no hubieran hecho nada."
8,3.5,"The history itself is uncomplete, for me, the books are the only material that we the fans need to complete the history. Nonetheless, the significance of the final decision, ""Bran the broken is the only one who can help us learn about our past mistakes"", turns out to be a poetic and very mature decision of the screenwritters, that can show us how our politics should be now. Not by electing a wise leader, but understanding that WE NEED TO KNOW OUR HISTORY. For me, it's a good ending."
8,2.5,I will say it in a simpler way what the fuck happened? The writers were on drugs Ruined one of the best TV series It has its moments but it's not enough How disappointing this season was.
8,3.0,"Come on, people. What did we expect? Khaleesi was well on her way to being, well, a dick. Jon went from rugged bastard/not-bastard hunky hero to a parody of a romance novel hero. Bran is weird. Sansa mistakes stern nods for gravitas. As with many companies, the bright stars fizzle out or move on, the egregious are ousted in hand-to-hand combat and the bureaucrats come up the middle to make the world a little more gray."
8,0.5,"If you dont already know, S8 was so bad it makes the entire run unwatchable. Weiss and Benioff did such a disservice to a once in a generation show it impacted their future careers and HBO's future GoT plans. However s1-7, if s8 wasnt so bad, would be the last of the great shows before the political agenda was shoveled down audiences throats in fantasy worlds (see Wheel of Time). It is heart breaking all around for a great cast in a wonderful and shocking tale of betrayal, murder, war, family, blood lines, mystical and wonderful all in one."
8,0.5,Absolute dog shit which is a shame considering the work the actors put into the series. It appears they knew themselves being awkward in interviews and afterwards working on their careers because honestly this could of killed careers like Star Wars. The series is fantastic until the characters do 180° personality flips contradicting their characters motivations in the previous 7 seasons of the show and basically throwing all storytelling and logic out the window. I have no idea why HBO let a tent pole series be wrapped up in a neat little bow the last season made the previous 7 seasons now unwatchable. Honestly it's fascinating how they had the biggest TV show on the planet and now the re-watchable nature of this once great show is gone. It's kind of deflating as a die hard fan but I'm hopeful House of the Dragon will do well seeing as the story is complete from a narrative standpoint and the studio only has to add dialogue; at least it knows where it's going. GOT Season 8: half a star because worse than having a bad ending it just made zero sense and all those we forgot interviews are mind boggling. I bet the HBO executives were scratching their heads as well hopefully they will check that the overarching story has an ending worth being made I doubt they will let that happen again.
8,3.5,What a disappointment. Still worth watching and still has some good moments but dang is it disappointing.
8,2.5,My rating for the s8 is a 5.0/10
8,2.0,"Beautiful imagery and soundtrack, but the writing... The plots, characters, everything was an unsatisfying mess."
8,1.5,they absolutely screwed ths final season up
8,5.0,"Critics are WAY too harsh. It's GOT quality all the way. Loved the ending, except I felt sorry for Drogon. Perhaps critics were just upset the series was over....I know I am."
8,0.5,"This season was the final nail in the coffin that destroyed the magic and greatness of this show for me. Hands down up to season 6, one of the best shows of all time. Then season 7 took it down a peg and season 8 just destroyed everything from all the great previous seasons."
8,0.5,"It felt completely separated from the previous installments of the series. It was ""Game of Thrones"" in namesake only. The decade long character arcs get thrown right out the window."
8,3.0,"I'm really disappointed. Jon and Daenerys deserved better than this awful writing. Only the Long Night, White Walkers and Dragons were the best part of this season."
8,3.0,That's how Studios ruin great things.
8,1.5,"Plotholes ✅ Bad dialogue ✅ Rushed plot/character development ✅ Not enough episodes ✅ the dumbest Dragon death of all time ✅ but also… One of the greatest GOT soundtracks (""The Night King"" in ep3) ✅ Impressive Acting ✅ Beautiful CGI ✅"
8,0.5,Season 8 episode 6 was extremely confusing blah experience. The dragon animation is the best. Drogon was the star. Jon Snow (Aegon Targaryen) must have some type of something to keep dragons from consuming him.
8,0.5,I haven't bought this season and I will only buy this season if it is in the bargain bin for $4.99 CND. I watched it and still can't believe I wasted my time on this shortened so-called season.
8,2.0,So sad that one of the greatest shows ever got such a horrible finale
8,0.5,I mean.- Did they even care in the end?...
8,1.5,Very rushed season and story. The flow didn't match the rest othe series.
8,0.5,Such a disappointment. The show writers/creators just threw away so much build up the led no where. Such a shame. Shame on them.
8,3.0,"Everyone got short changed. D&D are D&D's. Horrible writing to finish off what is award wise the best show of all-time. I dont blame them for 100% because George RR Martin deserves a majority of the blame. Since he decided to not write or finish the 6th installment and 7th within the last decade, his dream come true of a hollywood show gets crapped on and rightfully so........"
8,2.5,"The first half of the season was truly enjoyable and has some of the most emotionally resonant scenes I've ever seen in a TV show. The second half, well, I'm just convinced no one looked over the script or story after the first submissions and it led to one of the most unsatisfying endings in a TV show ever."
8,0.5,They threw everything we learned the past 7 seasons out the window
8,1.0,A sad ending to a franchise that started out at such an awesome level.
8,0.5,"Ruined the whole show. Such a great story wasted in the worst possible way with the most horrible final season ever. Everything feels so underwhelming, terrible and makes no sense. The writing is such terrible and feels very rushed. If u turn ur brain 100% off u might at least enjoy some fights and the special effects, but thats all that i can say. So much effort wasted bc of horrible writing, so sad."
8,0.5,I will never truly recover from the disaster that was GoT season 8... shame on all involved.
8,0.5,"Season 8 of Game of Thrones isn't just another ""bad season"" of a TV show. It's much worse, and the damage it inflicted on the series as a whole is irreparable. The final season manages to retroactively ruin the value in rewatching past seasons as well, because you know there's no pay-off for anything they set up earlier in the show. The incompetent showrunners, David ""Dumb"" Benioff, and D.B. ""Dumber"" Weiss, rushed this show's ending because they were ""bored"" of it and wanted to move on with their lives. So instead of doing the noble thing and handing off the reins to someone with more passion, they convinced their egotistical selves that they could wrap up all the plot threads in six episodes. The result is a disaster that killed the biggest pop culture phenomenon of the 2010s while simultaneously destroying their own careers. I hope they're proud of what they've done."
8,0.5,Worst ending of any show I have ever seen... the sad part about it? This was the best show I have ever seen.
8,2.5,bad writing still has some cool and fun scenes if your willing to ignore that
8,3.0,first couple episodes were good but after that is was a shit show
8,2.0,"This season felt rushed. Most of the character arcs were destroyed. The plot kept making characters make dumber and dumber decisions. After 7 seasons of ""Daenerys is not a murderer,"" she melts down King's Landing. This was a nice series, but the last season ruined it all."
8,0.5,"Travelling across terrain which took episodes in seasons prior now takes minutes, plot armour protects every main character in situations where they surely would die in seasons prior and everyone acting incredibly stupid, forgetting about things that they actually experienced or said in a few episodes prior. It is so abundantly clear Dumb & Dumber are great adapters of the books, but horrible writers in their own right and are selfish money hungry men who were so keen to wrap up the potentially best fantasy series ever to go and work on their SW project (now cancelled). A horrendous end to the show and it was starting to show big time in season 7. How do I sell my season 1-6 Blu Ray DVD's for cash? I can't watch them anymore, landfill like the ET Atari game coming up, I wonder how many dvd's have been ditched after this season.."
8,0.5,"Honestly, it's actually impressive they were somehow able to turn what was close to a perfect show that almost everyone loved, into something that no one even talks or thinks about anymore."
8,2.5,A crap ending to a great show.
8,0.5,Seasons 1-6 are near perfect entertainment. Seasons 7 and 8 has some of the worst writing and special effects in television ever. Seasons 7 and 8 are so bad that they make the incredible previous seasons difficult to watch knowing what's in store.
8,0.5,"The Absolute Best Example of The Worst Way to go about ending a sweeping epic Fantasy Story. This Will Go Down In The History Books.....and be on Top of the Heap (of Franchises that turned to Refuse/Garbage) This even made the likes of Alex Kurtzman & Jar Jar Abrams, themselves 'FRANCHISE ASSASSINS'.....BLUSH in embarrassment. For Shame."
8,0.5,"Games of Thrones is a masterpiece, but this last season lacks soul. The characters are no longer themselves. Good acting, FXs, picture, and localization but the plot is incongruent, abrupt, and not smart at all. It felt like they change their target audience, replacing the original one with a wider dumb one, resulting in a decaffeinate and soulless version of their previous seasons. Besides the amount of nice work they put in, I wish they would've canceled the show before just to avoid seeing how this has ended up."
8,5.0,Epic ending to a great story ! Only wish there had been more
8,0.5,Worst end I've ever seen
8,1.0,"The worst season, very disappointing for the fans"
8,0.5,"Not even worth half a star with this last Season. I'm not even able to rewatch all the really good season bevor, the ending ruined this show for me!"
8,0.5,"I recently rewatched the whole series. One episode into season 8, I thought ""Well, I remembered this season far worse."". After the second episode though, I hated it again. In my opinion, the best thing about GOT was, that even the main characters were vunerable. They had absolutely no plot armor. And now this. Like every protagonist should be dead after episode 3. To those who didn't watch through GOT yet, I can only recommend to never watch this season. Once you have watched it, you won't get it out of your head anymore."
8,5.0,"I think that this season finale is perfect for this show, it shows that something that should workout, but never really do. I can think of no better ending for such a amazing show."
8,5.0,"consensus seems to be wanting a predictable end but like surprises, and since I am not woke I don't mind that men come out on top. And No I'm not Russian."
8,0.5,"This season was so bad that I can't even rewatch other parts of the show. I'm not exaggerating. The acting is the only reason for the half a star (aside from the fact that it is the lowest rating I can give). You could tell the actors were trying their hardest to act out their parts cleanly with a poo-engraved script. Don't spend the ungodly amount of hours watching seven seasons, just to get to a final season that actively makes you despise the entire show. ""whO HAs a BeTtER stOrY thAn BRAN tHe bRoKeN!"" What."
8,2.0,Adding my review after all this time because I still can't get over what they did to an amazing show. Every thing that built up to the final was pointless. Horrendous ending and I hope those two are never allowed near a production again
8,0.5,"Completely ruined charachter arcs. That's pretty much what this season amounted to. Having to watch the great, complicated, and wonderfully explored characters of George RR. Martin being reduced to shadows of themselfs. D&D was clearly fed up with GOT, and wanted to move on. So they hastily boiled it all down to a stinking sludge that now is smeared all over this once so amazing show. Without Martins books to adapt, these hacks showed their true worth. Shame. Shame. Shame."
8,0.5,"Had to create an account to review this season, simply because of how often I still think about what they did to this show. Everything about this season was rushed and cheaply done. That starbucks cup is simultaneously meaningless and yet emblematic of the entire season. They should be ashamed for what they did to the CVs of every member of that cast and crew simply for being associated with this season."
8,3.5,"Too many are being too brutal on the final season. With everything we read pf what was going on leading up to production and final cut of the product, I think it was pretty good. And the fact it didn't do so well amoung fans tells me that it was very important series. Because of the love/hate of fan-to-series interactions from start to finish, I think it ended as a labor of love. I am not going to sit here and say what should of been. I watched thier show. I loved it and hated that it had to come to an end. Could it have been finished better, in everyones eyes, yes."
8,0.5,A maior decepção que eu tive
8,1.5,"The worst season of the whole series. Every season before had high ratings, but the directors and producers failed in every way possible. The ending was rushed, original characters were killed off in abrupt ways, and the story was overall dry. For a show with such a huge fanbase, the creators of this season did not think things through very well. It is now hard to recommend such a good show just because of how it ended. Unfortunately, Game of Thrones is a type of series that is 100% focused on the final outcome."
8,3.0,"Some nicely handled moments combined with the technical brilliance on display and great acting makes season 8 an overall fine watch, but here unfortunately, it is dragged down by rushed storytelling and poor handling of the main characters, shocking the audience without giving though-provoking or even compelling reasoning."
8,3.5,"The ending to this incredible show is awful. It is still worth watching though. While a lot of this final season is really just pathetic, there are events, like the Long Night, and the destruction of Kings Landing that still make this final season decent. It is unfortunate though. The show didn't have to end here. In my personal opinion, the 8th season should've been entirely deticated to the white walkers. After years of buildup, that is what fans deserved. Then there would still be an opening for many more seasons on who will sit on the Iron Throne."
8,1.0,"Sem sombra de dúvidas, toda a história da oitava temporada é muito disconexa, além de não fazer o menor sentido, desde a Daynerys enlouquecendo, até o povo livre que lutou para vir para o sul, voltar para além da muralha! Muito mal desenvolvida, diferente das 5 primeiras temporadas!"
8,3.5,"Besides Kahlisee getting what she deserved I thought the ending was bad. The Starks split up in all directions and Jon will live a quite miserable life. Disappointed, so much work and greatness squashed."
8,0.5,"I just wanted to add to the nearly 15,000 reviews saying exactly the same thing lol. Let's make a new rule for amazing, mainstream popular tv shows - no more poetically ironic endings!!! They always ruin things by trying to be too clever for their own good in an attempt to create 'high art'. Not every great show has to end in this type of academic literary way. Honestly, I just wanted to see Khaleesi and Cersei have the ultimate hand on hand cat fight to the death haha. Bran should have used his warg power to permanently possess one of the dragons. Jon Snow should have become king of Westeros. And something should have happened to indicate that 'the lord of light' was real or not and where the magic of the world actually came from. Maybe I'm basic, but I would have happily taken a simple but satisfying ending as opposed to this rushed convoluted mess. Shame of you D&D for getting lazy just when you should've worked harder than ever."
8,0.5,"GoT season 8 is a shame, scenario is very poor, battles are stupid, they ruined all the serie."
8,0.5,"GoT spent 7 seasons getting us to root for Dany (she freed slaves etc) and then the last season, she is all of a sudden a psychopathic monster????? Just awful. 7 seasons anticipating ""winter is coming"" and all it is is an army of the dead? Big whoop! Then all of a sudden the supposedly terrifying Night King is killed by Arya who swings into the scene like a flying squirrel. This is what we waited 7 years for? Dany and the dragons ruled. Thanks for ruining that GoT! I will not rewatch ""GoT"" or any of the prequels."
8,0.5,This season ruined the show.
8,1.5,"No clue why DB Weiss and David Benioff decided to kick their careers in the gutter by rushing out the final season of GoT into an extremely unreasonable mess. The first 2 episodes kept the pretense that this is a decent-quality GoT season, but the other episodes of the season really dropped from a mountain to a deep-sea in terms of quality. Really no idea why they had to do the things they did, but it'll go down in history as the biggest show with the worst final season."
8,2.5,"Essa foi a temporada que o público estava mais aguardando, esperando mais de um ano para a grande batalha, mas mesmo assim conseguiram decepcionar MUITO. Tendo o primeiro episódio bom, o que seria esperado e tendo o segundo episódio como o melhor de todos, lembrando muito as primeiras temporadas, com diálogos longos e ricos, sem problemas nenhum. Terceiro episódio que era o mais aguardado foi até que decepcionante, tendo uma batalha longa mas muito escura, aonde tinha momentos que não dava para ver muito bem. E o resto da temporada foi apenas boa, conseguindo jogar no lixo os arcos incríveis dos personagens que foram criados e tendo um dos finais mais jogado de todos e sem muita lógica. Mas em relação a efeitos e a fotografia de alguns episódios, não tem como reclamar, foram bem produzidos."
8,0.5,"Absolutely terribly written, feels lazy and rushed. So many plot wholes and too many things that don't make sense. Ruins the amazing first couple seasons of game of thrones."
8,5.0,"Beyond brilliant, the reviews are all wrong."
8,2.5,"este final es algo pésimo, sacrificando arcos de personajes solo para llegar al final"
8,0.5,One of the worst seasons of TV to ever air. The only thought put into it was how to end it quickly so everyone could move on to bigger contracts. You can watch videos of the actors reading the script and cringing at the steaming pile of crap that is Season 8.
8,1.0,Whoever says that season 8 was good only watched the series for the Gore/Action or has very low IQ i don't know how else to put it. It's like they took everything that happened before season 8 and threw it out the window. Characters feel like their whole development over the seasons has been reversed or at least set back to where they started in season 1. I don't even recognize some of them anymore. Also there are a lot of plot holes and things that don't make any sense. Hollywood plot armor and bad jokes are present to an extent that makes you just cringe. It's clear they just wanted to rush to bring it to an end and let it go with a big boom that was visually good but otherwise just utter trash.
8,0.5,"Horrível, Péssimo, Mediócre uma verdadeira M..."
8,3.0,"There's like one good episode here. The rest is a rushed, incoherent mess."
8,3.0,"Decent, but horrible compared to the first ones. Some brilliant moments, but feels more like a caricature of the previous seasons."
8,1.0,So many questions unanswered and so many answers unquestionably
8,1.5,Many characters we thought we knew over 70 episodes morph beyond recognition. A rushed mashup of crazy outcomes in the name of subverting expectations. A finale with next to zero payoff for the faithful audience. A bonus half star for some of the scenes in Ep.3.
8,2.0,"A complete disaster was avoided by the magnificent cast and the stunning visuals, but the writing is just an atrocity - thank God it's over."
8,0.5,David and Dan had such a thing going but they rushed it and ruined it so they could go work on other projects. Shame. Shame. Shame.
8,2.0,"O' curses! It started off so well too. The first couple of episodes were actually quite nice, and then they had to go and ruin it. It all started on ""The Long Night."" Not many things went wrong, just that ""eXPecTaTioNs wErE SuBveRteD,"" bad plans were made and the battle to end all battles had absolutely no structure whatsoever. It was just an hour full of stabby stabby and pokey pokey. Oh, and did I forget? Everybody is dumb this season! Yes, Tyrion, Cersei, Jon, Sansa (apparently the smartest person Arya has ever met), Dany, even Davos contracted a little bit of the dumb dumbs. It's nothing they couldn't prevent tho, given D&D don't care anymore, and just wanted to move on as quickly as possible. Anyway, before I get off in a tangent, ""The Last of the Starks"" is really the beginning of the end for GoT. Missed opportunities, stupid character decisions, and dialogue cutaways hit this episode hard, and it only gets worse from there. ""The Bells"" is the worst episode in all of GoT's history and ""The Iron Throne"" is the subsequent crapshoot that is the series finale. Dany becomes Hitler, Jon finally wakes up from his Long Nap, and Bran is made king (lol). Everything we wanted in the final season of Game of Thrones! But hey, at least our expectations were subverted! Let's go!"
8,1.0,"Worst ending to a tv show I've ever experienced. What used to be my favorite series of all time has lost all rewatchability, What's the point, knowing it ends like THAT."
8,5.0,"Far too many fans are overly critical of the final season. I've noticed the same with many big, popular series such as Lost and The Sopranos. People get so invested that no ending was going to leave them satisfied. I enjoyed all three of these series, including their final seasons and episodes. Kudos to GoT for such great work over nearly a decade."
8,1.0,"One of the worst season of any show I have seen. It's lazy, sloppy and just awful. Wish I could give it a lower rating."
8,0.5,"Incredibly shallow and uninteresting. The show maintains the visual, audio, and acting quality as previous seasons. However, the script is complete and utter trash. I didn't expect anything close to the source material, and they had to make something up since the books aren't finished but man, this is absolute nonsense. They didn't take the characters down a bad path, they took them all the way back to square one and some even further back to even more boring than in episode 1. It's like the entire series before this point did not matter at all, and what we got was a flashy, angsty hollywood spin-off movie."
8,1.0,How did Inlet a tv show make me this upset? What a massively disappointing end all around.
8,1.0,GOT is one of the best series I ever watched till S8 came along. The storyline did not hold up to previous episodes and the fate of Jon Snow is total joke! Just like seeing Brandon Stark as king. A character with no charisma and leadership. I wish I would have never watched it and left the fate of Jon and Daenerys to my imagination.
8,0.5,"The writing killed what should've been one of the greatest climaxes in entertainment history. They ruined such amazing performances, specifically wasted Clarke and all her infinite talent, and absolutely could in no way handle themselves as they stumbled into arguably the greatest failure of a season ever (once expectations and popularity and budget and acting talent are weighed in)."
8,1.5,Disappointing as hell itself.
8,0.5,"The lackluster ending was a small problem compared to the unconvincing progression towards it, blatantly disregarding the overall plot progression, character development and story setting."
8,3.5,"I even understood this ending, but I won't deny that it could be better."
8,4.0,"So many confused and selfish haters who believe this show should only have ended the way they wanted it to – whatever that was, so many different dream dashed and so much anger at not getting MY WAY! In reality, no matter what GOT did to wrap up the series they were doomed, because they had created a world that was so rich with possibilities that whatever path they chose would be sure to disappoint everyone invested in their own personal hopes and dreams for these characters. The reality is that the ending that was so tragic and so despised had actually been well-founded on years of hints, years of near-misses, years of Danaerys wanting to burn cities to the ground as her mad father had done, yet in every case - except the final one - she was held back by someone - Jora, Tyrion, Jon. But this time, at last, returning to the scene of her father's crimes, destiny caught up with her and she lost it, and let loose the madness that was in her blood. boo-hoo everybody is so personally offended, but it was GOOD STORYTELLING even if it was heartbreaking for all of us. Season 8 contained some of the best episodes (at least 2, especially the one before the battle of Winterfell) and scenes in the entire series and I think it is a terrible shame that so many viewers have just rained endless hate on the series that gave them so much joy. Guess what it wasn't only about you! Anyway, my rant, and watch, are done. :)"
8,1.5,"'My disappointment is immeasurable and my day is ruined'. What a horrible, terrible, rushed and deeply sad ending to an (until season 8) amazing show."
8,0.5,"A horrible thing. I expected more than this, this final don't have a mininum sense."
8,1.5,could have been considered the best show ever made if it wasn't for this train wreck season
8,1.5,The show was amazing but this season added so many plot holes and things that made no sense. It destroyed the characted arcs of so many and ruined everything that led up to the ending. It was trash
8,0.5,Events happen purely for the shock value. Literally the worst season finale than even LOST. Can't wait for the book.
8,0.5,"The last 2 episodes destroyed not only the 8th season but the entire series by completely ignoring years of character's arc building and changing dramatically their attitude for no good reason. Daenerys becomes an angry tyrant worse than Cersei, burns down King's Landing to the ground despite having promised during the entire series that she would respect the lives of innocents and liberate them from oppression and tyranny. Jon Snow finds out he is the rightful heir of the Iron Throne but refuses to accept his destiny and repeatedly claims that he ""doesn't want to be king"" despite having being confortable with the title of ""King of the North"" for quite some time in previous seasons, ends up being sent back to the Nights Watch (completely unnecessary now because there's no army of the dead or white walkers left to fight against), just doesn't make sense. Bran Stark spends the entire series depending entirely on others to survive, being carried around by Hodor or his friends, yet he's suddenly fit to rule the seven kingdoms and becomes king despite not showing any King-Like attributes at all during the previous seasons. Tyrion Lannister, the smartes guy around during previous seasons becomes blind to Daenerys true intentions despite being warned by his lifetime true friend Lord Varys (My absolute favorite character, impecable until his last moments) who dies after being left alone and betrayed by his friend Tyrion, for whom I lost all respect. A poorly written and rushed ending that left a lot more questions unanswered and a feeling that the writers just wanted to ""get it over with"" and ruined one of the most amazing TV series of all time!"
8,0.5,"Man, did they butcher the entire show in this season."
8,2.5,They really rush the ending and some character arcs got a bad treating.
8,0.5,"Everything up until now was good. They betrayed all the characters, all their personalities, and the logic of making a good ending."
8,0.5,"Not only terrible, undermined and ruined the entire rest of the series."
8,4.5,"If not the crappy ending! Immature writers or just weird point of view call it what you want, but a little kid could wrote a better ending, the first 7 seasons ? Absolute masterpiece, can't descirbe how perfect I mean it's HBO no limits! Even in violence you dirty mind ; ) Ramin djwadi the only man who's killing it til the end with his magical iconic soundtracks, other than that the final season got the potential to be the epic of epics in history of TV for me episode 3 should've, it was so near to get the title if not the shocking ending of it, episode 5 is the only one that is a game of thrones usuall level intense 10/10 episode, it could save the season but the ending made everything even worse. It's sad really but still must watch for all of you .. adults : )"
8,2.0,"Wow...I loved GoT and after the first 4 extremely good seasons, season 5 and 6 lacked a bit of story writing, characterization and dialogues, but were still good. Season 7 was a mix, but still very nice. But then... Season 8 has awful and cringy dialogues, in which many characters behave not like before. Half of the characters changed completely due to bad writing and seemed to became dumb or stereotypical. Everything is rushed too fastly, no build up for the big happenings in the story arc, a questionable ending which screams ""we didn't know how to end it, so let's just make a big boom"" and a lack of atmosphere. How could someone made such a bad ending for such a great series? Still good settings, visuals and some good scenes"
8,0.5,"Wish I could give it no stars, the most disappointing finish to a TV series ever."
8,2.0,"One of the biggest missteps in entertainment history. Season 8's rushed writing killed this show's legacy. GOT was on track to be the greatest show of all time, I was certain of it. I am appreciative to have experienced this blunder in real-time as I excitedly streamed the final episode on HBO on it's air date. The blowback was fierce, which helped with me getting over the disappointment of how it all ended. Sadly, season 7 & 8 made the entire show unwatchable."
8,2.0,"I liked the story that they want to create, they just badly failed executing that. The whole story feels so rushed. I am not against Daenarys being a mad queen, I just wished that they have executed it better."
8,2.0,"Was very disappointed, game of thrones is definitely a top 3 show of all time and they ruined it in season 8. They seemed to rush everything and I know I'm not only speaking for myself when i say it did not end in a way I wanted."
8,0.5,"Scriptwriting was the only bad thing, but it was so bad."
8,0.5,Just rewatched the entire show. Watching the final season again is physically painful. Never going to watch anything made by Dumb and Dumber again
8,1.5,"This is incredibly sad the Final it's so bad it single handedly ruined a magnificent series once compared to the likes of Lord of the Rings and others, a TV classic in the making and now it's best left forgotten. I tried to rewatch but I realized to myself ""It's pointless this all leads to nothing impressive or even worthwhile..."". My oh my to think D&D rushed this to go work in Star Wars is the cherry on the cake, and after that Disney denied them so ruining the final 2 seasons was in vein. RIP Game of Thrones 2011-2016"
8,0.5,They completely ruined the show's legacy
8,0.5,"Incredible show, at least till it follows the books. After it surpasses the books, problems start. Last season is best not mentioned. I refuse to believe this season exists. Yes, it's that bad."
8,0.5,bad ending I ever see
8,0.5,"Would of been better off not giving us an ending, compared to this."
8,3.5,Not the strongest finish to a great show. But it had some great moments…still worth a watch if you loved the rest of the series
8,0.5,Horrible ending to great series
8,1.0,This one season ruined the entire series
8,1.5,"An enormous letdown to say the least. This is only because of the writing- directing, acting and effects are still great. The creators took the wrong lessons from earlier seasons opting for maximal shock value and unpredictability which in their incapable hands meant undercutting a lot of the story's themes. It also didn't help that at least two seasons worth of plot was crammed into 6 episodes. The lack of a satisfying conclusion to most of the main character's arcs and overall plotlines completely hollow out the experience. At the end of the day the final season is beautiful to look at but has a very generic plot with nothing meaningful to say– completely unrecognizable from what the show was at its best."
8,0.5,Words can't describe how this season hurt my soul
8,0.5,"The worst finale to a tv show, period."
8,1.0,the season that murdered the franchise
8,1.5,"wjay, Tyrion has been the smartest guy in westeros for 7 seasons and in this it is like he was the victim of a botched lobotomy. Way too much girl power and turned Jon Snow into a simp, babbling , shes my queen. Just a disastrous way to end a great series/"
8,0.5,"Let's just say I am glad that D.B. Weiss and David Benioff don't have anything to do with ""House of the Dragon"". They ruined ""Game of Thrones"" so much that you can't watch it again."
8,0.5,D&D should have just asked other people to finish GoT instead of ruining it.
8,0.5,They really screwed the pooch on the final season. Very little makes any sense. Scenes and battles are overly drawn out. At season eight they were going through the motions to get it over with.
8,1.0,"Great Beginning, WORST Ending! The show is not re-watchable anymore..."
8,0.5,Bad just realy really bad
8,3.5,"If you've watched all the seasons, you have to watch the finale. That said, the complaint I heard most was the ending was unsatisfying. It seemed very fitting to me. Cercei and Jaime were destined to die together. Tyrion was rewarded for his loyalty and bravery by becoming the king's hand. Sansa was granted what she desired, to reign as a queen. Arya fulfilled her heart's desire to travel and seek adventure. Bran Stark was a unique character all through the series if anyone was paying attention. I'm not surprised he was the chosen one. Daenerys had become too vengeful to rule with integrity and grace. Her ending was beautiful, after death being swept away by her dragon, never to be seen again. Jon Snow remained the unhailed hero, returning to his humble obscure beginnings rejoined by his wolf and loyal friend, Tormund. Even Theon redeemed himself before dying. Everything ended as it should've. I don't understand the criticism of the ending. It couldn't have been more perfect. I didn't give it more stars because it could've gone longer. The final season felt rushed to me."
8,3.0,"The White Walker battle being dark didn't bother me. In fact, I thought it added a sense of being there, and eeriness. Mother of Dragons breaking-bad takes away from such a great rising character in the early seasons. Bran ""the Boring"" being king is unreal."
8,4.5,"I've had a bit of a journey with how I've felt about this season. While watching season 8 when it came out, I felt disgusted, saddened, and so disappointed by especially the last half of the season. However, the real reason I felt this way, I feel now, was due to an emotional obsession with Daenerys--her powerful story, her amazing achievement and flash. I was always so excited for her segments in each episode. I think I was so swept off my feet by her magic that I didn't think about what she (or I 😂) truly needed to be happy. Life was so unfair to her--what she came from. But life's unfairness affects everyone, but it alone makes none of us a good or bad person. I think now Daenerys became so obsessed with what she felt she was owed that she became detached from the needs of her self. Life got horribly unfair again for her near the end, when she lost the intimacy and support she'd needed and relied on from her inner circle--Missandei, Jon Snow (in a way), Jorah, and Tyrion (in a way) and Varys. She was faced with a very, very hard choice at this point, and I think she made the wrong one, despairing and resigning herself to sacrifice all the hope for love in her life. She chose the throne over a good life for herself. I think she could have found a way to find a new place for herself where she could take care of herself and be happy. In a way so, so sad to watch, I think she lost her internal battle to her woundedness and resulting feeling of entitlement. She was my Dany, my total crush on screen, and I loved her character. So, of course I was horrified and disgusted the first time I saw season 8. But, when I watched it again, it did make sense. I think it is a pretty cool commentary on entitlement and self by George R. R. Martin (to whatever degree the ending was the same as what his is)... How much of yourself are you willing to sacrifice to claim what you feel you are owed? If you can stop long enough to really think and be aware of how you feel, maybe you could see that being happy is better than any ""thrones."" What good is the throne if you are miserable? It's never too late to choose... I liked season 8 of Game of Thrones this time... episode 1 is beautiful, episode 2 is satisfying and tugs at the heartstrings, episode 3 is an amazing battle, episode 4 is an intimate look into a broken self, episode 5 is a study in dramatic tension, then a terrible tragedy you bear witness to, and episode 6 is... another terrible, dramatic choice and then... hmm, maybe not quite as strong at the end. I still feel the ""Bran the Broken"" beat is not nearly as satisfying as it ought to be. Maybe some more time and seasons could have helped make things even better, but after watching it again, it was all pretty cool to see. Other criticisms I agreed with in the past--Jaime's final arc, Arya doing the big honors, the whitewalkers going down so easily, Bran not using his powers enough, Tyrion not being clever enough--these all didn't bother me too much this time. I think the universe where these all happen does make sense. Is it the most interesting possible universe? Maybe not, but is that ever the case? I do still think Bronn is a bit annoying. One last thing--back to my girl Dany, maybe the commentary is--keep some healthy skepticism toward birthrights, entitlement, revenge, and justice... Maybe a fanfic could be fun where Dany decides to give it all up and go buy a ranch somewhere out in Essos and has sex and eats good food for the rest of her life. (Did I just reveal something about myself? 😅) Oh yeah and just briefly on the rest of the show. The first 4 seasons are truly amazing with how they weave satisfying plots and stories. The feel definitely did change at season 5 for me. It never got quite back to how it was in the first 4 seasons. But, some other cool things did happen. I think season 5 is my least favorite, looking back now. Oh, and the season 4 finale is my favorite episode now. Talk about pathos."
8,1.0,"TLDR: A shambolic end to a once exceptional fantasy TV show. Should probably only watch seasons 1-6 and pretend it ended there. Everything about this season felt rushed as opposed to a show that was once all about suspension and its world-building aspects. It came to a conclusion that felt as if though seasons worth of development crammed into a measly 3 episodes. The writing fell off a cliff, characters seemed like shadows of themselves and countless other plot contrivances that I can go on and on, but it's simply not worth talking about. It's truly disappointing for someone who's been a fan of the exceptional writing, character development and amazing battle sequences despite its lack of budget earlier on. Pls remake. 2/10."
8,1.0,Dumb and dumber perfectly describes the writers of this show.
8,0.5,"Very poorly written, did injustice to the previous seasons and books"
8,0.5,"I used to be obsessed with this show, it was so good but the last two seasons were terrible. The producers really ruined everything with their lazy rushed writing. I planned to re-watch all seasons after the last one but now I will never do that because it's just not worth it."
8,0.5,"Everything they built up until this season, all gone. They didn't close so many arc & plots properly. So many things that were illogical. If only they had taken their time to properly close all the stories & arcs."
8,1.0,The last season was a rushed mess. It didn't do this otherwise great series justice.
8,5.0,"FULL CIRCLE!! Extraordinary! I truly don't understand why people don't like season 8? It ALL makes sense. Granted a bit rushed. But other than that, everything happened as it should've!! I won't go over the same old stuff by saying how amazing the actors are and the whole show itself (""it is known""), but I will repeat myself and say the greatest show of all time. Period. I highly doubt we will see anything anytime soon that lives up to the high bar GOT set."
8,0.5,"The stupidest, most unsatisfying, meaningless, horrible season of all time. It's so bad that I don't want to rewatch previous seasons and if I go back I have a feeling I'll hate this piece of junk even more. Rushed events, character development destroyed, some smart characters were turned into incoherent donkeys, and dialogues weakened absurdly. I could give it more stars because of the great costumes, special effects, acting and high quality production, but that just goes to show how Game of Thrones has turned into a Hollywood blockbuster with big scenes and an empty script. The script ruined every enjoyment I could get from this season, because, as an example, it's no use making a dragon fly if this scene where it flies doesn't make any sense. The context behind the scenes matters more than how beautiful they look and the context sucks."
8,0.5,Sigh... Watching a second time was the worst idea ever... All the character build went up in smokes... Please remake season 8... =(
8,0.5,"This show started off so good but the last season was awful. It had weakened the last couple season but this final season was terrible, poorly thought out, with no consistency."
8,0.5,"Unfortunately, when you ruin the last season of a show like GoT there's no opportunity to fix the mess and redeem the story line and character arcs. The consequence is that the entire show is ruined. Prior to season 8, I encouraged people to watch GoT and immerse themselves in the universe. Following season 8, I now advise them not to bother."
8,0.5,Worst season ever in history!!
8,4.0,"Okay. First things first. I was very grateful for this series. The quality was there story writing was there and the acting was well done. But the final series desired more ...the huge fan base feels a let down. Myself, I feel the final season deserved more episodes but feel the rushed arcs were done well enough. This season still felt like GoT product but I could tell the producing team was ready to move on. Let downs in what I wanted to happen in story, emotionally attached during intense moments to the point of exhaustion. Theon deserved a better ending. Bran and the knight king deserved a better conclusion before the ""interruption"". Bran was almost a ruined character because of his abilities being unexplored and unopened. The Clegane bowl, as it was called, was disappointing but its because I remain biased towards a different outcome. And then (trying not to play spoiler) the king should of been the king. (as the writers were just being the plot twist masters) His ending was not done correctly. After everything, he ended up in the wrong situation, in my opinion."
8,3.5,"The show ist really good, the first episodes of the last season were pretty cool, but let's say I really hate the end and a bad ending makes the series look bad."
8,2.5,"As disappointing as it is (and believe me, it's extremely disappointing), it's hard to deny the spectacle of it all."
8,1.0,A rushed ending to one of the greatest TV series of all time.
8,0.5,This season took 7 seasons of character development and threw it in the garbage.
8,0.5,I loved the first seasons of GoT but season 7 and 8 are just horrible. You can feel that the writers just wanted to end this show and move on. The actors did a good job etc. but not even they could save the show from the lazy writing. It was so rushed and many things didn't make sense. D&D ruined what could have been one of the greatest shows of all time.
8,0.5,"An ill-made, spiteful little season. Full of absurdity, nonsense, and low cunning."
8,0.5,"With this season alone I felt like I wasted 8 years of my life. If you told me they fired everybody from the previous seasons other than the actors I would believe you. The writing is awful, the editing was awful, the things that made the show worth watching seasons 1 through 7 were completely lost in season 8 and made the show just horrendous."
8,0.5,Terrible way to finish. Feels like writers stopped caring.
8,1.5,Everything but the writing was amazing. How low the rating I gave it is should tell you something about the writing.
8,0.5,A masterclass in how to destroy a franchise in six episodes. The last two episodes in particular deserve special mention for trashing on all the character story arcs and making incomprehensible leaps in logic. As a result no one cares any more. HBO will no doubt bring on the sequels but I for one won't invest my time watching something that has demonstrated such callous betrayal of stories built over so lo long. You might have gotten away with it 20 years ago - but no longer.
8,4.0,I enjoy it but it could of been a lot better
8,0.5,Dogshit disappointment
8,0.5,"This entire season is a testament as to why following through in consistent writing quality is important. From massive plot holes to huge leaps in logic, Game of Thrones season 8 is far below the quality bar that was set by seasons 1 to 4 and will forever be remembered as one of the biggest flops in screenwriting history."
8,1.0,These writers should never work again
8,3.0,"The Greatest show of all time ends, But doesn't ends well. Due to rushed screenplay many things is left untouched, emotions, excitement any of these can't be felt. The ending could have been better if there were 2 or 3 more episodes. Expected better..."
8,0.5,"It was a very disappointing ending to such a good series, it was really unpleasant."
8,0.5,I thought season 8 and the few seasons before were just so sloppy and lazy season 8 was just diabolical don't even watch it
8,0.5,The Dumbers ruined the show.
8,0.5,"Great music, cinematography, set, cast, acting... Everything but the script. Script was garbage. Especially the last two episodes."
8,0.5,"Save us George please? #retcon this piece of shit! ""Best season ever"" is a cry for help!"
8,1.5,"Rushed, poorly written ending to an otherwise decent show. The complex character development, organic storytelling, and riveting dialogue that were present in previous seasons are completely absent."
8,3.5,"Despite the flak this season gets, it has some of the best setpieces and the ending was great imo. The only issue with this season is that it feels like some arcs did not get a fit conclusion. In addition to this, its very, very rushed with only six episodes. The third episode is easily one of my favorites, but some things just dont make sense in this season."
8,0.5,"Bad ending, different from the books and its unrealistic and sucks, I wish I never wasted years of my life watching this shit"
8,0.5,"let's just chalk this one up as a mistake, erase it, and retry on the silver screen, like the last terminator did."
8,0.5,Bad writing and rushed. Very disappointing for such a great show.
8,1.0,"The eighth and last season isn't based on any of the ASOIAF books. Yet another huge step back in the series. They could've used the source materials more, but the end result is still somewhat entertaining if frustrating, thanks to great actors, visual eye-candy, and score. Sadly, one of the biggest disappointments in television history."
8,0.5,It was the worst ending to an otherwise great show. Nothing feels coherent with the character arcs and story telling and it just creates a mess.
8,0.5,"I hope Amazon Prime learns the lessons of this ill-begotten final season and creates ""Wheel of Time"" more consciously."
8,4.0,"Despite the hate this season gets, I thought it was pretty good. Some of the things I didn't like but it was mostly good. The Long Night was amazing."
8,1.5,"It definitely had it's moments as you'd expect from a TV show of Game Of Thrones enduring quality, but unfortunately the creators failed to comprehensively execute an epic stories finale due to having rushed to the finish line and thus more questions than answers arise in the wake of it's undeniably controversial conclusion. Expected much more."
8,0.5,"An absolute trainwreck, which might have completely spoiled the book series as well."
8,0.5,"It's like D&D swallowed one of the best shows of the latest years and then puked it out half digested. And then tried to sell their puke as Season 8. They threw away 7 seasons of character developments (ok maybe 6 seasons), they threw away everything that made GoT good. They should never write anything again in their life."
8,0.5,"I wish there was a way to magically to take back all the hours spent watching this show, rewatching, theorizing, speculating, watching lore videos, theory videos and even reading the books - after the way this season happened. This season eviscerated not only just the show itself but all the fans' hopes and expectations. All that effort from the cast and crew was for what? All that passion from fans worldwide was for what? The writers blundered through this season and I wonder how toxic the culture must have been for them to get error after basic error into the script, abandoning stories, characters and physics that were established in previous seasons (sometimes abandoned between episodes). Were the writers not listening to criticism, feedback or ideas from the cast and the crew? I hope some time in the future there is an investigation into how such a colossal mess up was allowed to air and what horrors happened behind the scenes. Until then, I will try to forget this show ever existed, unsuccessfully."
8,0.5,"Since GRRM's fat ass and mega-chins never finished this series, the production team had nothing to work with and it shows: this is worse than nothing, a betrayal of every fan and the worst series ending in history after HIMYM. Just disappointing sewage."
8,5.0,I just finished rewatching the series and I see nothing wrong with the final season. I think it wrapped things up perfectly. I think at the time it when it first premiered people were salty that it was ending. I hope more people decide to change their mind about it after having given it another shot.
8,0.5,"The flip of Daenerys to act contrary to every value she held to her core values was absurd. File this under ""Lost-worthy Series Ending Failures""."
8,0.5,This season was the worst.
8,3.0,Yes it is not the best season in the series but I thought it was alright and of you disagree ok thats your opinion.
8,0.5,so dirty like stinky poo poo dirty pee pee poo poo
8,0.5,"Absolute disappointment, it should be 15% rotten tomatoes for season 8, everything was all over the place m. There were phrases that have never been said before that were backed up by absolutely nothing that made absolutely ZERO SENSE like for instance ""Sansa is the smartest person I know"".....are you kidding me? And I don't want to be bias but can someone tell me why she ever deserved to be the queen if the north? she was just countless times married off... I get trickster character development but it wasn't smart or queen worthy. and when Varys was betrayed by Tyrion and Dany by Tyrion.....I've never meet season 8 Tyrion in my life but I'd know he wouldn't survive any other previous seasons with that mouth. and DONT GET ME STARTED ON DAENERYS ""PLOT TWIST"" CHARACTER ARC? how does she go from risking her life and the life of her people to save thousands of innocent lives to...killing thousands of innocent lives....the biggest mistake in Game Of Thrones history...a disgrace. That will never be forgotten. I know for a fact GOT one a Grammy because most of the fans including me voted. even thought I hate the season with all of my entirety I still wanted the Gane Of Thrones title to always be remembered. D&D can shove it in there bums for all I care at the end of the day they will never be respected for botching one of the most well respected and popular show in the world."
8,1.0,The greatest TV shows has the dumbest ending. It almost looked like the creative team quit after season 7 and the final season was put together by some production assistants.
8,0.5,"Wow, what a waste of 7 seasons. The show runners ruined one of the best TV shows ever made. Poor character arcs. massive plot holes. aweful editing and cuts. meaningless rushed and cutted final season. unbelieveable in a year 2019"
8,0.5,"I'm just rating to make the score go lower, it's way too high right now"
8,2.0,"Season 8 was the biggest disappointment I have ever witness in TV history. I love GOT so much I have watched most of the series three times already, with of course the exception of season 8. The rushed feeling of this season was not what GOT was, previous seasons gave you time to feel and experience with the characters, this season just smashed a bunch of plot line into as few episodes as possible. My three favorite characters of the whole show died and I barely had time to feel it because they were on to something else so fast. The death of Missandei, was a HUGE deal and it was all but skipped over like she was some small side character that didn't matter, and then swept under the rug pretty much right away never to be mentioned again. I am honestly shocked that the creators, producers and actors would allow such an epic show to end this way. Let's not of course forget about the incredible heroin that was created in Daenerys, that they allowed to turn into just another crazy bi*%$ that let her emotions take control of her. Completely ruining everything they had created in her, taking away ALL the strength that had been built into 7 glorious seasons of her. What a amazing display of misogyny, yet again by Hollywood. They had the opportunity to let this amazing, strong woman continue to grow in strength and over come her hardships and adversities and traded all that for what? A pyrotechnic who wanted to play with fire? She and all the women of the world deserved better, as did the men who could have used to see such a beloved character not turn into a stereotypical crazy woman. Now let's move on to Bran, are you kidding me? The literal dullest, most boring character to ever exist (throughout the entire series) is the chosen king?? How? Nobody knew him, he had done absolutely nothing to deserve it, and was nothing but weak, relying on everyone else to save him the entire series! No king like qualities at all. On the subject of kings, the king of the white walkers death, yet another tragic disappointment, a threat since the first episode deserved an epic battle, not 30 seconds, good choice on Aria killing him but she also deserved an epic battle as well after everything she had been through to become who she was. I could continue to go on but I'll end there. The fans and the characters deserve a remake in which they can forget about this horrible season and actually get a real ending to one of, if not the most epic TV show ever."
8,0.5,Worst final season for a formerly great show
8,1.5,"Call me a sheep, but like everyone, I hated the last season and detested the last episode. This season should have been split in 2 seasons. Considering how popular the show was, they would have had no problem in keeping an audience. The end was so rushed, and the change of the characters was so quick and absurd, they were able to detrone Game of Trones from what could have been one of the best TV hows ever made."
8,0.5,"This was honestly my favorite TV series of all-time before season 8. I was disappointed with the previous few seasons, but a good finale would of made it all worth it. Completely character assassinated Jame, Daenerys and Jon. ""She's Mah Queen"". ""i dun wan it"". Words honestly cannot describe how disappointing this was for me. Now it looks like we won't even get Winds of Winter and HBO wants to give us some more content that literally no one has asked for. I'm honestly done at this point. So sad. So much potential wasted. #remakeseason8."
8,5.0,I really enjoyed a lot
8,0.5,"The writers took one of the greatest TV shows of all time and rushed through the final season so badly that they completely screwed up the entire show. Everything that happens in season 8 is actually pretty interesting and subversive, which I like. But they didn't give any of the plot threads enough time to adequately build and then resolve. Everything just happened all of a sudden with no build-up, no nuance, and no thought. Literally everyone wanted to do a longer season or more seasons except the showrunners. HBO wanted more seasons, the cast and crew wanted more seasons, George R.R. Martin wanted more seasons. But the showrunners selfishly didn't feel like it and they ruined the whole show just to serve themselves."
8,4.5,(Series) One of the best shows to ever do it. Iconic moments throughout and very well written up until the final season. Still one of my favorites despite the feeling of lazy/rushed writing to send off what was one of the best shows of my generation.
8,0.5,What a nice way of messing up a nice story. I can't believe it could end like this. I'm still shocked by how bad the ending was. Now I know why everyone hated the final of this series. Hope the book with the real story of George comes out and will be definetly a much better story and ending.
8,1.0,"Every single character arcs were thrown in the garbage, except for Arya, The Hound, the Mormonts, Theon, Beric, Melisandre and maybe Jon. Jon pretty much because I don't look at him like a king, but rather a fighter, the one (imo) who was supposed to KILL the Night King. Don't even get me started on the Night King and his army, I am pretty sure the only good thing that came from this episode was the ""Dance of the Dragons"" battle, Melisandre, Arya in the library, Jorah's and Beric's and Theon's deaths, and ofc the PLOT ARMOR. Rest of the season was idiotic, except for the Cleganebowl and the Mad Queen (just so suprising and unexpected), Rhaegal's, Cersei's and Jaime's deaths are just wtf!"
8,0.5,"Absolutely disappointing closure to the series, the final season ignored previously established facts and character traits. The story is rushed and badly written, the characters lack depth and overall the season doesn't make sense at all"
8,1.0,"Game of Thrones: Season 8 is probably the biggest disappointment in my entire life. Overall, I love GOT, it's my favourite tv show, period. Seasons 1 - most of 7 are just masterful. But this is absolutely terrible. But it's not all bad, I love everything in this season up until Episode 3: The ""Long"" Night. Now I actually like most of this episode but the battle tactics are dumb and Arya killing the Night King is so stupid and just undeserving. Everyone knows that Jon should've done it, not Arya, Jon. Episode 4 was meh, I guess. Rhaegal's death was the dumbest thing in the show but Missandei's death is good (while heartbreaking). And episode 5 is the worst thing ever. The writers do not understand Jaime, they do not understand Dany, they don't understand...anything. Jaime was my favourite and the way he and Cersei died was just laughably bad. Episode 6 however, it's actually alright, it has some stuff that I like and stuff that I don't but my biggest problem with the episode was that I just didn't buy the fact that Dany was evil all of a sudden. Overall, GOT season 8 sucks and to the writers: Dracarys."
8,0.5,Rushed. Nonsensical and utterly poorly written. Acting was excellent as was the CGI and production (We can let the Starbucks cup slip...) But by god did D&D screw this royally up. I will attempt to wipe this season from my memory and live in the days of season 1-6.
8,0.5,"Final terrible, se siente apresurado, sin sentido."
8,1.5,"Perhaps the most disappointing ending to a pop culture phenomenon that the world has ever seen. An unbelievable fall from grace for one of the best TV shows of the decade. Special effects and acting remain top-notch, but the caliber of writing here is truly abysmal."
8,3.5,"O grande final de Game of Thrones acabou sendo uma grande decepção. Ainda que o desfecho tenha sido acertado e alguns momentos tenham sido inspirados, a pressa prejudicou a narrativa e destruiu o desenvolvimento dos personagens. O que salva é 3 episódio sendo o melhor episódio de toda a série com uma batalha que é uma obra de arte! A pior temporada que está empatada com a quinta mas esta consegue ser pior porque era pra ser A FINAL DE GAME OF THRONES! Teria de ser uma obra de arte!"
8,0.5,just ruined everything. worst finale ever. bad bad season for a nice show.
8,0.5,"After extremely compelling writing, and build up in all of its previous seasons, it is clear that the final season was extremely rushed. Season 8 was extremely disappointing, and I would argue that it would be better all together if it was never made all together, even if the show and its ending is never resolved, it's better to leave the show on a cliff hanger, than to provide the audience with an ending that isn't at all earned."
8,0.5,"Considering how great the first seasons have been written, for that GRRM had provided his source material. Considering how much depth and potential this world and its characters had. Considering how many storytelling mistakes writers can make. Considering all this, there is no greater fall from grace than Season 8 of Game of Thrones. If I look for a compendium of all the possible mistakes you can make in storytelling, this would be the prime example. It has nothing to do with my disliking of where the story went and of how the writers squeezed the content of at least three more seasons into one. The problem of this production is its flawed writing. It also has nothing to do with how the potential and depth of the characters was wasted because it's just brought to an unsatisfying ending, leaving the audience clueless about so many things. The problem is that the character arcs and their background is inconsistent with the previous seasons. It's also inconsistent with the lore. It's like a Star Wars sequel in a GOT world. This could have been the greatest TV production of long times. It's such a disappointment where this went. I hope for a reboot of seasons 7 and 8 once GRRM releases his last book."
8,0.5,GOTS08 was blasphemy and a hammer in the face off all the day one fans who helped build the popularity of this show. This series should be a case study in filmschools on what happens when directors get greedy and sloppy. Traumatizing.
8,1.0,bloody waste of my time!!!!!!!!!!!!
8,0.5,"yeah disaster from the writers DnD, sloppy writing and felt like writers just want this to end and also don't want any other writers to extend it so that no one gets the credit."
8,1.0,"Game of thrones ending was very disappointing the whole series is breathtaking and marvelous, but the ending just ruined it completely they could have ended the series so many different ways so sad that they chose it that way"
8,0.5,I wish I could kind of forget the last season of this show like a huge fleet of warships that wait in ambush.
8,0.5,"This show went from being a generational event that redefined the television show to being completely forgotten. Early Thrones all the way to Season 6 was some of the best television I've ever seen. No character no matter how important was ever safe and it made Thrones the most entertaining show on television. Characters really made the show what it was so when the ending for these characters is butchered, it makes everything that came before it utterly unwatchable. Every spin-off or prequel that comes from the Thrones world will be haunted by this season unless it is completely disregarded and remade in some way. Possibly when or if The Winds of Winter comes out and Martin puts out the real ending, HBO would consider it and they should. Anything is better than what D&D cooked up. This show was the closest to perfect I've ever seen and what Season 8 did to it is criminal."
8,0.5,Never seen so many plot holes. The god tier dialogue present in season 1 looks like from a completely different show when comparing to season 8.
8,0.5,Worst ending in the history of television. D&D should have taken GRRM approach to this season. They should have NEVER done it!
8,0.5,"They ruined it, would have been better if never finish... I've watched it all until last season at least 4 times... now I so disgusted, not only I can't watch it again, I didn't watch Dark Phoenix and won't watch Eternals because the mere sight of those actors piss me off!"
8,0.5,Really ruined an amazing series with giant plot holes and ignoring plot lines completely...
8,2.0,"Visually stunning yet incompetently written, this fever dream of a season will likely result in the show losing its so-called ""cemented"" status as one of television's great series."
8,2.5,It was not the ending anyone expected.For a show that is so good.This is very disappointing.
8,1.5,"There are just so many better ways the season's last few episodes could have ended. It was completely rushed, the storys character arcs never felt fully resolved, and it was just a shame to see such a fantastic show end in probably the worst way possible. But thats what happens when not very talented showrunners have to create an ending themselves and not rely on source material."
8,5.0,Yes some disappointment that it wasn't as epic as it could have been but still gave me some incredible moments. 5 stars no hesitation
8,0.5,"A complete let down. Given the ending, I would not recommend watching it at all."
8,0.5,Amazing how one season can completely obliterate any thought of ever watching your favorite series ever again. Just amazing...
8,0.5,Don't bother watching S1.
8,0.5,"Even well over a year on, any time I hear GoT season 8 being mentioned, I'm furious. The first couple of episodes were solid and the second did a great job of building tension before the oncoming slaughter.  I was thrilled with the third episode when it aired, but when you look back at how many characters escaped certain death, it infuriated me further.  The Dothraki literally rode to their death (WHICH WE ALL SAW LIVE) and 50% of them survived?  Then they seemed to multiple at King's Landing?  This is just one of the countless examples of terrible writing.  I mean, come on...  D&D completely butchered everything good about the show.  The character development, the subliminal messages, the many, many potential/exciting endings and they decided to sell out to collect a paycheck from Disney (only to be fired later - LOL - good for you both).  You don't need to look any further than the actors speaking about season 8.  Even they knew it was a joke.  D&D turned their backs on common sense and brilliant writing/storytelling (which declined the minute RR Martin stepped away) to give us some over the top, theatrical BS that was packed with unauthentic CGI.  Arguably giving us the worst final season in television history.   GoT was a show that I wanted to watch back for decades.  Now, knowing the pitiful excuse of an ending, I just wish I could erase GoT from my memory banks to remove the pain.  Thanks for wasting nearly a decade of my life, D&D :)"
8,4.5,"Solid season, was better on a re-watch of the show."
8,1.0,Season 8 was like a sad fart after a good meal....
8,5.0,I saw all the seasons in 2 months of quarantine. I really liked it and this last season didn't seem bad because I didn't notice any change in the quality of the show. Maybe I'm not as much a fan as others especially of got books but I enjoyed it. Not everything has to have a happy ending.
8,5.0,"%30 alması sizi yanıltmasın. Asla kötü bir sezon değildi. Düşük verilmesinin sebebi izleyicilerin hep hayal ettiği şekilde bitmemesi. Evet ben de aynı şekilde hayal etmiştim, ama benim hayalimdeki gibi de bitmemiş olması sezondaki sahnelerin, oyunculukların kötü olmasına sebep olmuyor. Çekilmiş en iyi sahnelerden bir kaçı bu sezonda. Mutlaka izleyin ve BİTİRİN."
8,0.5,"It's over a year to this series but every time I come across clips of it reminds me how awfully the whole series was ruined and destroyed with the last season. The main storyline of white walkers ended in a fraction of a single episode, with no mention of the king who was promised (Azor ahai). it feels bad to see 8 years of hard work and a good story all went in vain."
8,1.0,Worst finale to the greatest series of all time
8,2.0,"loved the series till this mess, did not like the ending, did not like the characters story arcs, the actors did a great job with what they had to work with, which apparently was very little."
8,1.0,It was trash not at all a good ending
8,2.0,"Game of Thrones ends in a sad and distressing way, but real fans will find solace in the performances, visual efects and the incredible soundtrack that made this TV series so iconic."
8,3.5,I really enjoyed all of game of thrones including the last season... I think the internet went into a bit of a frenzy of criticism which wasn't warranted. The long night and the bells are two of the most harrowing and epic action episodes of anything I've seen.
8,4.0,"Season 8 of GOT is not horrible, but it could definitely be better. It was WAY too short and the characters were crappy with the lines being delivered very foolishly and not well. It could've been made better, and it definitely didn't give a good wrap for the series, but it had its satisfying moments that carried out a so-so season filled with craziness like never before."
8,1.0,terrible. it was like it was written by a completely different writer than the first few seasons.
8,0.5,"well, you can tell that George RR. Martin had not written the ending ! The scenarists were really not up to the task, they ruined what would have been one of the most memorable TV shows ever. Now it will only be remembered for it's horendous last season."
8,1.5,"Lazy writing in an attempt to wrap it up quick, nice, and neat with a bow on it. They botched the end of one of the best series of all time. We had years invested, and to see it end like this was pitiful. Characters making decisions and acting completely at odds with their usual selves to try and rush the story to the end. Really sad that the writers got lazy and quick and chased the Disney/Starwars money instead of finishing what could have been their greatest masterpiece. In the end it's the long term fans that suffered."
8,0.5,Are you serious. YOU CAN'T BE SERIOUS.
8,3.5,"There is so much hate surrounding this season, but honestly, I thoroughly enjoyed it. There was definitely some questionable writing moments that made me face-palm, but 8x03 and 8x05 still stand out as fantastic episodes within the shows history. Also the budget of these final 6 episodes is unimaginable - it paid off though."
8,0.5,This season totally blows.
8,1.5,I can't watch Game Of Thrones now knowing how it ends! Terrible rushed season! There were some parts that I liked but the majority left a bad taste in my mouth. D&D destroyed this amazing show
8,0.5,"A horrible and unjust massacre. Not talking about the massacre that Daenerys did, but the one that the writers did. They mercilessly slaughtered all the featuers that made GoT great and reduced it to a grotesque caricature of itself. Just horrible."
8,4.5,"The widespread low opinion of the final season of a show about a fictional society crumbling under the weight of war and lust for power says more about the audience than the show. It is the belief of many around the world that we are living in a pre-apocalyptic era. I think that many of the people who feel that sense of impending doom looked to Game of Thrones to reflect that reality and offer some validation to the solutions they believe in. Season 8 didn't deliver that; what it did instead was finish a compelling fantasy story with a set of tragically ironic truths that offer a resolution that might be complicated and dissatisfying, but ultimately might be more poignant and valuable. The one person qualified to rule is the one person who can see everything that has ever or will ever happen, and who's mind is not corrupted by desires. In other words, the one person who doesn't exist in the real world. If that isn't good fantasy, I don't know what is. Maybe all the Dany fans who feel so blindsided by the outcome and claim that they didn't see it coming would have felt less so if they'd accepted from the beginning how bad of an actor Emilia Clarke is. She is unworthy of this truly remarkable role and always has been. The problem with bad actors is they make it harder for the audience to absorb the story. We have to deal with a bad performance blocking the way. It's like driving in heavy rain. How can I say this? One of the standard negative reviews of the final episodes is that the character's evil turn comes out of nowhere and is not set up properly, rendering it not believable. The positive reviews then go on to list all the many things the character does throughout the series that justify the outcome. All the killing, all the jealousy, all the narcissism. It's there from the end of Season 1. The actor did not sell it, or maybe she just thought she was selling something else. But that does not mean the story isn't being told. It just means that we in the audience have to pay closer attention. Is that unfair to us? Of course. But casting made a mistake at the outset with a principle character, and she didn't do poorly enough in the beginning to justify replacing her (I think her best performances are in the first few episodes of the series.) Besides, what matters most is that the story is great, and there's nothing wrong with making the audience work a little. I'm sure she's a great person, but Emilia Clarke got a lucky break she didn't deserve. She's not the only principle who could have done a better job, but she had more on her shoulders than anyone and, unfortunately for all the fans who pinned their hopes and dreams onto her, wasn't up to the task. To all of you complaining about bad writing, bad production, bad pacing, bad story arcs, and any other general complaint, I say go write and produce your own book series turned hit TV series. Good luck."
8,4.0,"I am amazed how this season has such a low rating, although they say badly about the script the rest is spectacular, of course it is not my favorite season but I think it is very underrated !!!"
8,0.5,"The writing is just so awful, it hurts to see something that you liked, that you looked forward to, just go to ruin. What a waste, just hurts to watch."
8,0.5,"Season(1-7) was build up to something epic and it was a big let down. I used to recommend this show to people , now I tell them to avoid it. Very poor writing , this season was as if they ran out of money and tied everything up. This season focused on cinematic rather then writing. Very poor writing, stay away from this whole series its not worth it."
8,1.5,"Decisions that would've been thematically brilliant if they were given more time and arcs that have built up over 10 years ruined in 6 episodes, this was the most disappointing way that one of the greatest shows in history could've ended."
8,0.5,"Honestly, I don't really get it....the season is to short each episodes are long but lack of screen time of each one of main characters which is disappointing even Messandei's death has no meaning at all and especially THE LONG NIGHT Arya as Azor Ahai? That's ridiculous she wasn't part of the story that Jon has I mean Jon has face The Night King twice (not in combat) which is the most disappointing of the entire season ""The writers"" should have watch show from their mistake instead of reading the script."
8,2.5,"Probably good enough TV production values, and certainly watchable, but a great disappointment after what had come before, It as if they had thrown away much of the character development during the previous seasons, and the culture of the books and rushed to get it finished as if they had become bored with it and wanted it out of the way at any costs."
8,5.0,I can accept story and ending. The details are not enough. However I cannot think more better ending.
8,1.0,The quality went down very sharply in this season. Season 7 was meh but 8 is terrible. There's so many plot holes it's ridiculous. There are too many things that was wrong with season 8. The list would be huge. Its not even about the ending. It was about the journey. This season was very disappointing.
8,0.5,"Congratulations, Game of Thrones has officially dethroned Lost, Dexter, and How I Met Your Mother as the WORST series finale in recent memory!"
8,0.5,"What a... joke. Honestly this was my favorite show on television. This last season, makes it difficult for me to justify it being my favorite show ever. First off... SIX EPISODES!!!?!?!?!? WHAT. That should just explain itself. Rushed and shortchanging its central characters, the first 3 episodes get a barely passable C. THE LAST THREE EPISODES OH MY... what were they trying to do? They single handedly ruined Jon Snow's character by showing us two major plot points about him, (you guys know), BUT IN THE END IT MEANS NOTHING TO THE CENTRAL POINT OF THE SHOW. Unreal. These guys literally sacrificed good story telling, for set pieces. When you look back on game of thrones, you will see a show that was ruined by its last season. It is sad to say but it is just true. Final season gets a 2/10. PATHETIC"
8,0.5,"I didn't realize how bad season 6 and 7 were until I watches season 8. Those 2 seasons makes more sense why they were so bad after watching Season 8, they shouldn't have rushed it. This was bound to happen when they too that route from season 5. We should've known better. Everything was as grandeur as other seasons except for the writing and the plot. It was disappointing, really really disappointing."
8,1.0,I can't believe it had such a bad season 8. After going through all this for 7 seasons. Best would be to make a 9th season and treat as if the whole 8th season was a bad dream.
8,0.5,"The writting and dialogues in this season are simply terrible. Almost all characters were ruined and anything makes sense at all. From the first to the third episode it was kind of ok, although the battle against the Night King was very disappointing. But man, from the fourth episode ahead was all just so bad that i couldn't even say, especially that ending, which is one of the worst i have ever saw in my life."
8,1.5,So terrible it's sad. I loved the other 7 seasons. Too bad the author is so greedy and didn't care how his story ended.
8,4.5,"I enjoyed it and was satisfied with most of it. Loved episodes 1, 2, 3 and 5. Ad a few ussues with episodes 4 and 6. Episode 4 was going great until they left winterfell, then i think the director did't do a great job. Episode 6 loved it until Drogon flew away with Dani's corpse. I was satisfied with the end for Arya, Sansa and John but i hated the rest. The execution of the dragon pit meeting was really bad, not against Bran beeing chosen as King but i din't limed the execution. And serioisly Brin as Master of coins? I think the show would have benefited with a couple more episodes because tit feeled rushed at times. But overall i enjoyed it and i didn' ft disapoinred as i felr with LOST's finale season."
8,2.5,"it is hard to please everybody with such a huge amount of complex characters, but this season feels nonetheless enormeously rushed."
8,0.5,"The creators of the show were offered multiple episodes to conclude the show by HBO but they declined so that they could wrap it up quickly and get to their Star Wars trilogy that they had planned with Disney. Game of Thrones is a show that's one big chess game, it's essential that you stick the landing and this finale is probably one of the most nonsensical, rushed and lazily written finale's ever made. This finale was so bad that all talk of the GOT franchise as a whole died as soon as it ended, like everyone had selectively decided to just forget it had ever happened in the first place. The finale ruined not just the finale season but GOT of a whole and if I could give it negative 5 stars then I would cause this was my favorite show and I had put in some time and investment like quite a lot of people."
8,1.5,she is my queen..... This season is just nonsense
8,1.0,Your writing is so terrible you can't even apply for McDonald's
8,1.5,"Damn! Now i can see why fans were so pissed about this finale. Hell, it doesn't even feel like a finale. It feels more like any other season in this show, only less competent and more stupid. This entire final season feels so corporately manufactured and half-assed that all the aspects that made the other seasons great are nowhere to be found here. The beautiful cinematography and great special effects are nowhere near enough to saving it. It also has a thing for not knowing how to subvert the audience's expectations in a way that works. Instead, the writers slap us in the face with twists that don't make any sense, terrible writing decisions and characters that have been dumbed down so much that we almost don't even recognize them anymore. How was George okay with this? I have no idea. A once-great show ends on a stinker of a final season with an underwhelming and anti-climactic finale. way to go, Hollywood."
8,0.5,"Season 8 completely lacks any of the intrigue, complexity, or cleverness from earlier seasons, making it abundantly clear that very little of the genius of earlier seasons actually came from the show-runners themselves (but rather, entirely from GRRM). Dialogue is minimal and desperately fails to capture the intelligence of previous seasons, and high budget (and admittedly beautiful at times) stunts are used to cheaply disguise the lack of depth in the story this season. Actions no longer have consequences, and foreshadowing is tossed aside for shock-value. There is little logic to how things play out, and it seems who comes out on top is based solely on the show-runners own personal preferences rather than story build up."
8,0.5,Horribly written and devoid of logic and sense a franchise ruined and sent to oblivion to be forgotten.
8,0.5,"horrible horrible horrible, they ruined the show"
8,0.5,Poorly thought out. Rushed. Seemed underfunded. Unfortunate.
8,0.5,"So many inconsistencies. The intricate and intelligent political games left the series the moment the books stopped. The writers messed up the whole thing. The production value which once was considered canon, is now careless with water bottles and Starbucks cups and horrid lighting. What a horrible disappointment this was. I hope the 'writers' never do any more 'writing'."
8,0.5,This entire season was pure trash.
8,0.5,"The fact that D&D obviously rushed the final season, due to biting off way more than they could chew career-wise, makes me unable to forgive how horribly and utterly they ruined such a fantastic show and story."
8,3.5,"A pesar de que la temporada en general pareció terminada medio con los dientes y a las corridas, creo que el desarrollo sí fue satisfactorio y que no fue out-of-character. A lo largo de toda la serie nos advirtieron el final de Daenerys, quién se queda con el Trono fue medio un plot twist pero a la vez no, y la verdad que al final quedó demostrado que la historia más importante era la de la familia Stark, con quienes empezamos y terminamos, a los que seguimos a lo largo de todas las temporadas. El invierno llegó y pasó y la verdad que... sí, me gustó mucho el final. The pack survives (and thrives)."
8,1.0,Shortcut major character and story arcs to finish the series. Even the Major action sequences were disappointing - which was seemingly all that this season was aiming for - Battle of Winterfell was nonsensical in the tactics and strategies used (Helms Deep remains the pinnacle). Still consider the overall series unfinished as I cannot sensibly join this to the seasons before in my mind!
8,5.0,"Game of Thrones is one of my favorite series. This particular one is awesome!! I love the characters, the acting, the scenery and wardrobe. It's perfection."
8,0.5,"Why would you do this to the amazing TV series, with amazing source material. The writers should be forced to serve as G.R.R. Martin's toilet attendants until his demise, for their crimes against his masterpiece."
8,0.5,David Benioff and D.B. Weiss are greedy money grubbing traitors. May the fans haunt their career for a lifetime.
8,2.5,"First 3 episodes awesome! Last episodes horrible, talk about rushing a show to end and killing it in the process... so sad. For me this was the best showed ever until they ruined it."
8,0.5,The writers' miniscule amount of effort to write a proper ending breaks the fourth wall.
8,5.0,"Love all eight seasons. I guess by looking at the scores, the whiners didn't like the ending. Yikes! When you read a book the ending is always going to be the same no matter how many times you read it. I personally loved it!"
8,0.5,The greatest show on tv but the worst ending in the history of television disgraceful disrespectful. If you like the show just quit watching at the end of season 7
8,1.5,"It had the ingredients for something great. The choices I didn't hate, it just wasn't built up. It wasn't earned. It could of been something amazing. The choices if done right could of rivaled some of the best episodes. Characters who evolved and grew throughout the show, die abruptly, don't get a proper send off, just act dumb... The first four episodes I didn't mind. But the last two I hate. I HATE. So rushed. It was like they gave up writing it and just wanted a plot twist. Game of thrones was better than that. And man the Lord of light did nothing but light some swords. Real dumb. Urgh. Saddens me"
8,0.5,"Subverting expectations should not just mean shocking the audience with random crap that had no setup. Waited a year to rewatch the season with fresher eyes, but it sadly fails at concluding one of the best fantasy shows of all time. Hope the writers deal with Star Wars was worthing fucking over this beloved show."
8,2.0,"Every other season was WAYYY better but honestly i'd recommend stopping at season 5 or 6 at the very latest.. The rest isn't really the same show anymore.. The fame got to the writers and they felt that they had to surprise everyone.. They put ""subverting expectations"" ahead of good narrative decisions.. They dumbed characters down and ruined multiple storylines that were INCREDIBLE up until season 5-6.. Don't bother with 7 & 8.. they were baaaaadd and its better to not possibly spoil the upcoming book(s) (if they are ever released)"
8,0.5,"An absolute train wreck. Characters we've established over seven years suddenly act completely out of character. All sense of solidity to the world, that there are consequences for mistakes and errors, that travel is difficult and takes time, vanish. People survive certain death ""just because."" People die, ""just because."" The writers said as much in their post-hoc rationalizations for destroying the show with no regard for the story they built up. Or rather, the story someone else built up, they streamlined for television, and when they had to finish it, were not just completely incapable of that, they retroactively destroyed the entire show. An ending this bad DOES ruin the entire work. You can't put poopoo frosting on a cake and act surprised when people don't care how good the middle is, it was ruined, and can not be salvaged."
8,0.5,"I feel that Dan and Dave did NOT do the show justice. This final season was a messy rush! All previous seasons are completely undermined due to the fact that all character arcs, all foreshadowing of what's to come, and all concept of show pace were thrown out the window in a NOT so blaze of glory. I can only hope that all future endeavors HBO has with GoT related material are done in a consistent manner across the board. I wholeheartedly appreciate the time and effort put in by the cast and crew because at the end of the day they do not have the final say, the producers and show writers do. So for the future, it's probably best to not allow selfish writers to speed through to the end because they have other projects being offered to them at the time because the show has made them popular (ie Star Wars... I'm glad they lost it)."
8,2.0,"Was watchable,enjoyable but in the end disappointing, too many characters killed off too many storylines rushed,episode 5 I thought was terrible."
8,0.5,"Over a year later, and I still feel a burning hatred when thinking of this season. The characters we've come to love and admire are non-existent, props of what they use to be, mere line-dispensers for the writers. Nobody acts as they would be expected to, nothing is justified, warranted, or earned. The acting, music, and visuals were great as always, but those things only exist to augment the narrative, a narrative which, in this case, was virtually non-existent. When the rage has alleviated, all I'm left with is a feeling of utter disappointment, because this season could have been great. It could have wrapped up the stories in a respectful, satisfying way, but it didn't. It could have stayed true to the characters, done right by its villains, and put in the effort to build up the world, but it didn't. And here's the real kicker, the most disappointing thing of all. The writers didn't even try, and it shows."
8,2.0,"first few episodes where good but the later ones just seemed rushed and didn't mesh with the narrative they spent 7 season creating. Danny's desent into madness seemed extremely and fast considering everything she had already been though, it didn't fit the character as we knew here and in the end after all the lead up to John's parentage he was just banished back to the Knights Watch even though he was the true heir to the Iron Throne and a good man! Just didn't sit well. All in All I was pretty disappointed with the last season and what they did with another of the characters. Sad!"
8,4.0,Unlike most people I thought the ending was clever and emotionally satisfying. The production standards were amazing and all was concluded with honor.
8,2.0,"More than one year later, this season still infuriates me. Somehow, David Benioff and D.B. Weiss dropped the ball on one of the greatest shows of all time...."
8,2.5,"Apologies if this is going over old ground but having rewatched this on blu ray I wanted to comment. Rather like some other high profile TV series, the last season of GoT is rushed; it's pretty obvious the creators had other projects to abscond to. As a result of a reduced amount of episodes (and I'm surprised the execs at HBO allowed this as there were easily two seasons worth of story left), logic went out of the window in terms of character development and the choices that they end up making. I totally understand that it is up to creative teams what happens in their shows, but mass audiences know bad writing when they see it, and a certain amount of backlash must be expected. I'm not an obsessive GoT fan and I've not read the books, but to craft a show in the way that it was and then allow it to conclude as it did seems almost negligent, putting the reputation of the whole franchise at risk. This is not to say that there aren't any positives. The pacing of the first two episodes and spectacle of the third are excellent. However, there is a steep decline in storytelling for the second half of the season, with a feeling that the writers had forgotten what had happened in the previous seven series, trying to tie up as many loose ends as possible. I can only hope that the proposed prequel wipes out the negatives of what was generally one of the best television programmes there's ever been."
8,0.5,Nothing is worth an ending this bad.
8,1.0,"The ending was inevitable, it was the journey to that ending that caused it to fall flat. The previous seasons were a journey allowing the characters to evolve naturally. The final season was moving chess pieces to their required location regardless of their current position or natural evolution."
8,1.0,"This season is a middlefinge to the whole fanbase, put lightly. To walk away from this and feeling proud, counts as being proud of being a nazi general. A shame, and a waste of time"
8,0.5,The worst finish in TV history. The books are dumb too.
8,0.5,"The worst final season of any show ever. Idiotic, rushed, nonsensical and totally insulting towards viewers. I will never forget this disappointment until I live. Period."
8,3.0,"It was a great show with such a crappy ending, the storyline of this season would have been good if we had more time to flesh it out. The last 3 episodes seemed to destroyed all character development for the sake of a quick ending and forgotten things already established on the books and the show itself. It would have been more epic to see everyone death with the Night King ruling the Iron Throne."
8,1.0,"What once was possibly the best written drama in television history turned into a boring, painfully poorly written shadow of its former self. It did however remain unpredictable in its later seasons, consistently having the viewer on edge, waiting to see how much more stupid it could become. D&D did an excellent job at adapting George RR Martin's novels, but a terrible job at writing a story themselves. I mainly just feel sorry for the cast and crew."
8,1.5,DONT WATCH PAST SEASON 5! IT ISNT WORTH IT!!
8,2.0,"I admit it, the end destroyed me, not only did I saw what was going to happen, but I was also very disappointed, the character of Danny had a radical change of mentality as if from one episode to another he became an idealist dictator. She always was a person that was demonstrating her power but there was that mentality and empathy that he felt towards people that was what we liked about her, and the end of the season took away all that that made them a beloved and admirable character. It doesn´t mean that it wasn't an amazing season, it was a great series that combines drama, fantasy in a cruel world with complete characters, and it was probably the best tv show that I ever saw."
8,2.5,Game of Thrones Season 8 | Detailed note: 5
8,4.5,"All people want to do is complain and complain when things don't go exactly the way they want them to personally go bit-by-bit And it's pathetic, season 8 may not have been the best but it was a very good finale"
8,2.0,"This final season was a disappointment. There was too much rush to finish it and that destroy how the story was told, the empty dialogues are prove of it. The photography didn't add as much as expected."
8,0.5,"I can't imagine the casts especially Jon snow actor told the fans to f**k themselves. He implied that if so much work is put into season, there shouldn't be negative comments, and those fans should f*** themselves. We should boycott the whole 8 seasons of GoT, let them suffer money loss and tell them who is the king and who paid their salary. It is really incompetent and absurd that the genius turned dumb and numb. And a kid turned into a superman to kill night king who is so much powerful than the mountain. Furthermore, night king can resurrects the dead as long as it is not damaged by dragonglass or fire. So he can hide himself and let their generals and WW do his job and kill that stupid brann. Brann do nothing in season 8 to help or kill anyone, and yet looks numb. This is absolute terrible show, I won't support it."
8,0.5,How to ruin a good series and piss of all your fans. It could have been legendary known as one of the greatest TV series of all time. Now it will be a cautionary tale for directors that get to stuck up their own asses.
8,0.5,"The show lost its wit with the dialogue here big time. Horrible, emotionless, and dialogueless death scenes of prominent characters So many things you thought would eventually be explained, is never explained What some characters choose to do make absolutely no sense at all. You will end up hating some characters for their sudden change of character for the worse. Characters you thought at some point will serve a purpose, for the lord of light, or whatever ""greater"" purpose they were meant to serve, simply DON'T. It's all pent up hype that leaves you utterly disappointed. Practically everything that's been hyped leaves you saying ""that's it?"". Either make the show based off the book or don't hire incompetent writers to butcher the show. What a shame."
8,0.5,"This show is dead to me! I never loved a show this much, but you broke my heart!!! You broke my heart, GOT! Trashy script, sloppy editing ! It's like watching Skittles commercials. Go sleep with the fishes, GOT!"
8,2.0,"I'd been looking forward to Season 8 so I could go back and binge watch the whole series afterwards. Now I never want to see anything GoT again. Characters are reduced to caricatures, plot holes are painful to watch, and internal logic and consistency are things of the past."
8,1.0,I'm guessing Jon Snow is now King of the Wall?... This ending was horrible! Breaking Bad writers would never!
8,1.5,"The cast and crew gave it their all, the writing fails to live up to the previous seasons by a metric ton, even Season 7. Character assassination, the movie. D&D did really well at adapting the story to screen, but they ran out of story and the show became so big that they focused on spectacle, rather the character interactions and intricate political maneuvering. It is totally fine to have action and battles, especially in the series finale, but the show is driven by the characters and the characters were all written terribly with the primary character assassination being Danaerys. Theon's resolution was the only character that wasn't butchered and even then his ending is just okay."
8,2.0,Such a terrible failure of a final season. It wasn't unwatchable but it certainly destroyed the legacy of what was otherwise an amazing series. After that nobody talks of Game of Thrones in hushed tones any more.
8,0.5,Absolute disgrace to the show.
8,1.5,"I watched the serie going on, i watched with passion and i loved it then the final season come, from a good serie the make ot trash they throw away the last seasons in trash, the throw the characters in trash, we had the good daenerys they make her mad more then the made king, we had jon snow that appear to be (aegon targaryen) that was a good leader he became a sheep, there was alot of better way to end it even if they want make jon kill daenerys. They waste alot of time on useless things they could weite more event then only fights they wasted the series at the end."
8,3.5,"I am a contrarian on this one, but it is not my choice on how a show ends. I was appreciative of the glimpse of George R. R. Martins's imagination. GOT was an awesome show while it lasted."
8,1.5,I can't believe how they managed to mess this up. Everything feels rushed. Characters don't feel like themselves. I'm so disappointed. I can't believe I made my friends watch it.
8,1.0,"Game of thrones was a amazing show, and the final season failed. Daenerys', and Jaime's character arcs are thrown in the trash. Cersei's prophecy gets thrown away. Bran becoming king was a absolutely horrible decision, Arya abandoning her family for no real reason is both unrealistic, and unsatisfying, and Jon going to the wall makes no sense, since there is no point to even have the night's watch at this point, and Euron is either able to shoot perfectly to kill Rhaelgal, or not able to shoot at all when it comes to drogon. Euron is basically useless. And by the end of show, dozens, upon dozens of mistakes piled up in one disgusting pile. Grade:F"
8,4.0,"Of course it's not the best season in the series, but in all honesty, there was no better way to end such a terrific show. In the final 30 minutes, the show was wrapped up perfectly and left me mostly satisfied."
8,2.5,"Sad to see a show I love so much be ruined by a few bad episodes. Without George's brilliant source material to hide behind, D and D fail miserably."
8,1.0,"It used to be one of my favorite shows ever, all these years wondering what was about to happen next. This show has gone from the best show ever to the worst show ever. It's so bad it hurts to watch. There are sooooooo many plot holes, inconsistencies,worthless dialogues, useless penis jokes. Once you've watched this and you go back to the previous seasons, you start to see even more plot holes unravel. I will never ever watch this show again. All the money that could have been made with merchandising afterwards, likedvd box sales, posters, conventions, in short a whole culture could have existed, if it wasn't for the writers flushing basic storytelling rules down the toilet. I wish I had never watched it to begin with. I used to tell everybody to watch it, but then season 8 came, and then nothing."
8,0.5,"Across all movies, tv shows, video games, And real life I have never been let down so much in my entire life I had to go to therapy for 6 months just kidding about the therapy but this season was so bad I couldn't have made it worst if I tried the first episode is great but every episode after that is significantly worst then the last by the last episode you will wish you never saw the last season and just imagined in your head or something stupid like that just so you wouldn't have had to watch it that was my favorite show of all time but now I won't even rewatch it cause they just ruined it, it was rushed out with no thought in 6 episodes with no care"
8,0.5,"It's amazing how quickly GOT went from being the greatest story ever told on the silver screen, to the biggest television failure of all time. I'll most likely never rewatch it."
8,0.5,Half a star for the music still bring great
8,2.5,"Mientras los primeros tres capítulos calientan la temporada de forma eficiente, los tres últimos ofrecen nada más que decepción."
8,0.5,"An absolute disaster. The previous worst moments in the show were at worst boring and dumb but watchable, this season is legit terrible, even compared to other TV-shows. Do not watch it if you care about your brain cells."
8,0.5,"The worst possible ending for game of thrones. Rushed and completely destroyed the pourpose of the other 7 seasons... did dumb and Dumber ""kinda forgot"" what GOT used to be ?"
8,0.5,"It takes a lot to destroy a fanbase. It takes even more to destroy seven seasons of brilliantly crafted storytelling in six episodes. It just goes to show that you can have beautiful costumes, sets, visual effects and landscape shots, but none of those can make up for a plot that not only destroys every main character, but their reasons for being as well. Never, have I seen a movie or TV show self destruct like this, or make the rest of the show hard to rewatch because of one season. It needs two more seasons. It needed no mad queen, no Targarean Jon Snow. No ""You are my queen."" It needed more time to breathe, it needed more Night King development and it needed two competent writers, not whatever these two guys are."
8,0.5,This season just show off how D. B. Weiss and David Benioff are really bad writers by trying to continue this story by their own after the original material of George R. R. Martin went over.
8,0.5,"Season 8 was absolutely horrid. Makes me not want rewatch any of the seasons for how terrible this ""finale"" of a season was. Rushed, and terrible writing."
8,0.5,Do not give these guys another show or movie to make. Lazy asses
